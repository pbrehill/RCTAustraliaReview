Objective  To assess the sustainability of effects of a home-based early intervention on children‚Äôs body mass index (BMI) and BMI z score at 3 years after intervention.

Design, Setting, and Participants  A longitudinal follow-up study of the randomized clinical Healthy Beginnings Trial was conducted with 465 participating mothers consenting to be followed up at 3 years after intervention until their children were age 5 years. This study was conducted in socially and economically disadvantaged areas of Sydney, Australia, from March 2011 to June 2014.

Interventions  No further intervention was carried out in this Healthy Beginnings Trial phase 2 follow-up study. The original intervention in phase 1 comprised 8 home visits from community nurses delivering a staged home-based intervention, with one visit in the antenatal period and 7 visits at 1, 3, 5, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after birth.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Primary outcomes were children‚Äôs BMI and BMI z score. Secondary outcomes included dietary behaviors, quality of life, physical activity, and TV viewing time of children and their mothers.

Results  In total, 369 mothers and their children completed the follow-up study, a phase 2 completion rate of 79.4% (80.9% for the intervention group and 77.7% for the control group). The differences between the intervention and control groups at age 2 years in children‚Äôs BMI and BMI z score disappeared over time. At age 2 years, the difference (intervention minus control) in BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was ‚àí0.41 (95% CI, ‚àí0.71 to ‚àí0.10; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.009), but by age 5 years it was 0.03 (95% CI, ‚àí0.30 to 0.37). No effects of the early intervention on dietary behaviors, quality of life, physical activity, and TV viewing time were detected at age 5 years.

Conclusions and Relevance  The significant effect of this early life home-visiting intervention on child BMI and BMI z score at age 2 years was not sustained at age 5 years without further intervention.

An Effective Child Restraint Program: Buckle-Up Safely",2015,"Objectives: We sought to identify the program fidelity factors associated with successful implementation of the Buckle-Up Safely program, targeting correct use of age-appropriate child car restraints.

Methods: In 2010, we conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of 830 families with children attending preschools and long day care centers in South West Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Families received the Buckle-Up Safely program in the intervention arm of the study (13 services). Independent observers assessed the type of restraint and whether it was used correctly.

Results: This detailed process evaluation showed that the multifaceted program was implemented with high fidelity. Program protocols were adhered to and messaging was consistently delivered. Results from multilevel and logistic regression analyses show that age-appropriate restraint use was associated with attendance at a parent information session hosted at the center (adjusted odd ratio [AOR]=3.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.61, 8.29) and adversely affected by the child being aged 2 to 3 years (AOR=0.14; 95% CI=0.07, 0.30) or being from a family with more than 2 children (AOR=0.34; 95% CI=0.17, 0.67).

"Taft, A.J., Hooker, L., Humphreys, C.¬†et al.",Maternal And Child Health Nurse Screening And Care For Mothers Experiencing Domestic Violence (Move): A Cluster Randomised Trial,2015,"Background
Mothers are at risk of domestic violence (DV) and its harmful consequences postpartum. There is no evidence to date for sustainability of DV screening in primary care settings. We aimed to test whether a theory-informed, maternal and child health (MCH) nurse-designed model increased and sustained DV screening, disclosure, safety planning and referrals compared with usual care.

Methods
Cluster randomised controlled trial of 12 month MCH DV screening and care intervention with 24 month follow-up.

The study was set in community-based MCH nurse teams (91 centres, 163 nurses) in north-west Melbourne, Australia.

Eight eligible teams were recruited. Team randomisation occurred at a public meeting using opaque envelopes. Teams were unable to be blinded.

The intervention was informed by Normalisation Process Theory, the nurse-designed good practice model incorporated nurse mentors, strengthened relationships with DV services, nurse safety, a self-completion maternal health screening checklist at three or four month consultations and DV clinical guidelines. Usual care involved government mandated face-to-face DV screening at four weeks postpartum and follow-up as required.

Primary outcomes were MCH team screening, disclosure, safety planning and referral rates from routine government data and a postal survey sent to 10,472 women with babies ‚â§ 12 months in study areas. Secondary outcomes included DV prevalence (Composite Abuse Scale, CAS) and harm measures (postal survey).

Results
No significant differences were found in routine screening at four months (IG 2,330/6,381 consultations (36.5 %) versus CG 1,792/7,638 consultations (23.5 %), RR = 1.56 CI 0.96‚Äì2.52) but data from maternal health checklists (n = 2,771) at three month IG consultations showed average screening rates of 63.1 %. Two years post-intervention, IG safety planning rates had increased from three (RR 2.95, CI 1.11‚Äì7.82) to four times those of CG (RR 4.22 CI 1.64‚Äì10.9). Referrals remained low in both intervention groups (IGs) and comparison groups (CGs) (<1 %).

2,621/10,472 mothers (25 %) returned surveys. No difference was found between arms in preference or comfort with being asked about DV or feelings about self.

Conclusion
A nurse-designed screening and care model did not increase routine screening or referrals, but achieved significantly increased safety planning over 36 months among postpartum women. Self-completion DV screening was welcomed by nurses and women and contributed to sustainability.

"Burford et al.,",Internet-Based Photoaging Within Australian Pharmacies to Promote Smoking Cessation: Randomised Controlled Trial,2013,"Background:
Tobacco smoking leads to death or disability and a drain on national resources. The literature suggests that cigarette smoking continues to be a major modifiable risk factor for a variety of diseases and that smokers aged 18-30 years are relatively resistant to antismoking messages due to their widely held belief that they will not be lifelong smokers.

Objective:
To conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a computer-generated photoaging intervention to promote smoking cessation among young adult smokers within a community pharmacy setting.

Methods:
A trial was designed with 80% power based on the effect size observed in a published pilot study; 160 subjects were recruited (80 allocated to the control group and 80 to the intervention group) from 8 metropolitan community pharmacies located around Perth city center in Western Australia. All participants received standardized smoking cessation advice. The intervention group participants were also digitally photoaged by using the Internet-based APRIL Face Aging software so they could preview images of themselves as a lifelong smoker and as a nonsmoker. Due to the nature of the intervention, the participants and researcher could not be blinded to the study. The main outcome measure was quit attempts at 6-month follow-up, both self-reported and biochemically validated through testing for carbon monoxide (CO), and nicotine dependence assessed via the Fagerström scale.

Results:
At 6-month follow-up, 5 of 80 control group participants (6.3%) suggested they had quit smoking, but only 1 of 80 control group participants (1.3%) consented to, and was confirmed by, CO validation. In the intervention group, 22 of 80 participants (27.5%) reported quitting, with 11 of 80 participants (13.8%) confirmed by CO testing. This difference in biochemically confirmed quit attempts was statistically significant (χ21=9.0, P=.003). A repeated measures analysis suggested the average intervention group smoking dependence score had also significantly dropped compared to control participants (P<.001). These differences remained statistically significant after adjustment for small differences in gender distribution and nicotine dependence between the groups. The mean cost of implementing the intervention was estimated at AU $5.79 per participant. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was AU $46 per additional quitter. The mean cost that participants indicated they were willing to pay for the digital aging service was AU $20.25 (SD 15.32).

The evaluation uses a randomised controlled trial that tracks the outcomes of J2SI participants (Group J) and compares their outcomes with those of a comparison group (Group E) who are being supported by existing services. After 24 months the evidence shows a sustained improvement in the housing circumstances of the J2SI participants compared to those in the control group. Critically, most (86%) have maintained their housing. While the move to independent housing was difficult in the beginning, the high rate of housing retention suggests that most of the participants are developing the skills and confidence needed to keep their housing.

"Parker et al.,",An Oral Health Literacy Intervention For Indigenous Adults In A Rural Setting In Australia,2012,"Background
Indigenous Australians suffer substantially poorer oral health than their non-Indigenous counterparts and new approaches are needed to address these disparities. Previous work in Port Augusta, South Australia, a regional town with a large Indigenous community, revealed associations between low oral health literacy scores and self-reported oral health outcomes. This study aims to determine if implementation of a functional, context-specific oral health literacy intervention improves oral health literacy-related outcomes measured by use of dental services, and assessment of oral health knowledge, oral health self-care and oral health- related self-efficacy.
Methods/design
This is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that utilises a delayed intervention design. Participants are Indigenous adults, aged 18 years and older, who plan to reside in Port Augusta or a nearby community for the next two years. The intervention group will receive the intervention from the outset of the study while the control group will be offered the intervention 12 months following their enrolment in the study. The intervention consists of a series of five culturally sensitive, oral health education workshops delivered over a 12 month period by Indigenous project officers. Workshops consist of presentations, hands-on activities, interactive displays, group discussions and role plays. The themes addressed in the workshops are underpinned by oral health literacy concepts, and incorporate oral health-related self-efficacy, oral health-related fatalism, oral health knowledge, access to dental care and rights and entitlements as a patient. Data will be collected through a self-report questionnaire at baseline, at 12 months and at 24 months. The primary outcome measure is oral health literacy. Secondary outcome measures include oral health knowledge, oral health self-care, use of dental services, oral health-related self-efficacy and oral health-related fatalism.
Discussion
This study uses a functional, context-specific oral health literacy intervention to improve oral health literacy-related outcomes amongst rural-dwelling Indigenous adults.

- non-professional mentor support to reduce intimate 
partner violence and depression in mothers: a cluster 
randomised trial in primary care.",2011,"BACKGROUND: Effective interventions to increase safety and wellbeing of mothers experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) are scarce. As much attention is focussed on professional intervention, this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of non-professional mentor support in reducing IPV and depression among pregnant and recent mothers experiencing, or at risk of IPV.

METHODS: MOSAIC was a cluster randomised trial in 106 primary care (maternal and child health nurse and general practitioner) clinics in Melbourne, Australia. 63/106 clinics referred 215 eligible culturally and linguistically diverse women between January 2006 and December 2007. 167 in the intervention (I) arm, and 91 in the comparison (C) arm. 174 (80.9%) were recruited. 133 (76.4%) women (90 I and 43 C) completed follow-up at 12 months.

INTERVENTION: 12 months of weekly home visiting from trained and supervised local mothers, (English & Vietnamese speaking) offering non-professional befriending, advocacy, parenting support and referrals.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes; IPV (Composite Abuse Scale CAS) and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale EPDS); secondary measures included wellbeing (SF-36), parenting stress (PSI-SF) and social support (MOS-SF) at baseline and follow-up.

ANALYSIS: Intention-to-treat using multivariable logistic regression and propensity scoring.

RESULTS: There was evidence of a true difference in mean abuse scores at follow-up in the intervention compared with the comparison arm (15.9 vs 21.8, AdjDiff -8.67, CI -16.2 to -1.15). There was weak evidence for other outcomes, but a trend was evident favouring the intervention: proportions of women with CAS scores ‚â• 7, 51/88 (58.4%) vs 27/42 (64.3%) AdjOR 0.47, CI 0.21 to 1.05); depression (EPDS score ‚â• 13) (19/85, 22% (I) vs 14/43, 33% (C); AdjOR 0.42, CI 0.17 to 1.06); physical wellbeing mean scores (PCS-SF36: AdjDiff 2.79; CI -0.40 to 5.99); mental wellbeing mean scores (MCS-SF36: AdjDiff 2.26; CI -1.48 to 6.00). There was no observed effect on parenting stress. 82% of women mentored would recommend mentors to friends in similar situations.

"Sherman et al.,",Experiments in restorative policing: Final report - Canberra Reintegrative Shaming Experiments (RISE),2011,"This report describes the results of the first three years‚Äô research on the largest criminological field
experiment ever conducted in Australia, and one of the largest world-wide. RISE, the
Reintegrative Shaming Experiments, compare the effects of standard court processing with the
effects of a diversionary conference for four kinds of cases:
‚Ä¢ drink driving (over .08 Blood Alcohol Content) at any age
‚Ä¢ juvenile property offending with personal victims
‚Ä¢ juvenile shoplifting offences detected by store security officers
‚Ä¢ youth violent crimes (under age 30)
The diversionary conferences consisted of a meeting between the offender and at least some
family or friends of the offender, the usual presence of the victim or (in the case of drink driving)
a community representative, and a police officer who facilitated the meeting. These often highly
emotional meetings, which took roughly 90 minutes (compared to around ten minutes for court
cases), addressed these issues in this order:
‚Ä¢ what the offender did
‚Ä¢ the harm it caused
‚Ä¢ the worse harm it could have caused
‚Ä¢ ways to repair the harm
‚Ä¢ a written agreement between police and offender on exactly what the offender will do to
repair the harm
These are the three central hypotheses of the experiment:
1. Both offenders and victims find conferences to be fairer than court
2. There will be less repeat offending after a conference than after a court treatment.
3. The public costs of providing a conference are no greater than, and perhaps less than, the
costs of processing offenders in court.
The present report addresses only the first of the three hypotheses. Data on the second and third
hypotheses are still being collected, and insufficient data are presently available on those
hypotheses to produce even a preliminary report. All findings described in this report are also
subject to modification as additional data are collected and analysed.
The findings from direct treatment observations are based upon the completion of at least one
independent observation report for 86 percent of drink driving offenders, 66 percent of Juvenile
Personal Property offenders, 75 percent of Juvenile Property (Security) offenders, and 68 percent
of Youth Violent Crime offenders. The findings from offender interviews are based upon
completion rates of 85 percent for drink driving offenders, 76 percent of Juvenile Personal
Property offenders, 73 percent of Juvenile Property (Security) offenders, and 72 percent of Youth
Violent Crime offenders. The findings from victim interviews are based upon completion rates of
87 percent for Juvenile Personal Property victims and 82 percent of Violent Crime victims.
ii EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The following summarises the key findings from the experiment to date:
1. The Experimental Sample Is A Highly Active Group of Repeat Offenders
At the time that the more than 1100 offenders in this experiment were referred by police officers
after an arrest, the offenders self-reported the following levels of offending:
‚Ä¢ Drink drivers admit to an average of 19 occasions of drink driving in the year preceding their
RISE offence.
‚Ä¢ Eighty percent of all drink drivers in the sample admit to at least one prior occasion of drink
driving in the preceding year.
‚Ä¢ Juvenile personal property offenders admitted to around 50 prior offences in the year before
entering RISE, most of them property crimes, with an average of two police contacts.
‚Ä¢ Seventy percent of juvenile personal property offenders admitted to prior property offending
and over half to prior violent offending in the preceding year.
‚Ä¢ Juvenile property (security) offenders admit to about 40 offences in the preceding year, mostly
property crimes, with an average of one police contact.
‚Ä¢ Youth Violence Offenders admitted to about 22 offences in the preceding year, including an
average of two violent offences and an average of one prior police contact for a violent offence.
2. The Offender Sample Uses Alcohol and Marijuana at High Rates
‚Ä¢ The average BAC of drink drivers in the experiment was .12.
‚Ä¢ Half of the drink driving offenders report using marijuana on occasion; 15% are daily marijuana
users
‚Ä¢ Almost no drink drivers admitted using heroin or cocaine
‚Ä¢ More than half of the juvenile and youth offenders report using alcohol 2-3 days per month or
less
‚Ä¢ Over half of the juvenile and youth offenders report using marijuana at least occasionally, and
some regularly.
3. Victims Suffered Substantial Harm
‚Ä¢ Medical treatment was required because of the offences against 62 percent of the youth violence
victims, almost all of them in a hospital emergency centre.
‚Ä¢ About seventy percent of property crime victims suffered financial harm.
‚Ä¢ Emotional harm commonly included increased suspicion and fear.
4. Conferences Treated Victims Better Than Court
‚Ä¢ Property crime victims were notified in good time for 77% of the conferences but only 15% of
the court cases.
‚Ä¢ Violent crime victims were notified in good time for 75% of the conferences but only 36% of
the court cases.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY iii
‚Ä¢ In 81% of the property crime conferences but only 5% of the property court appearances, the
victim was present at the proceedings.
‚Ä¢ In violence cases, 91% of the victims were in attendance at conference cases but only 13% were
present at the court cases.
‚Ä¢ Victims received apologies from offenders in none of the court proceedings, but victims whose
cases were heard at conference received apologies in 67% of the property cases and 82% of the
violence cases.
5. Conferences Differed From Court In Many Ways
Based on systematic observations of both court and conference by independent observers, great
differences were found on the following dimensions:
‚Ä¢ Time and effort given to justice: much more for conferences than court
‚Ä¢ Participants: many more in conferences
‚Ä¢ Emotional intensity: greater in conferences
‚Ä¢ Procedural justice: greater in conferences
‚Ä¢ Restorative justice: greater in conferences
‚Ä¢ Retributive justice: greater in court
‚Ä¢ Reintegrative shaming: greater in conferences
‚Ä¢ Stigmatic shaming: greater in conferences
‚Ä¢ Defiance: somewhat greater in conferences
‚Ä¢ Apologies: many in conferences, none in court
‚Ä¢ Forgiveness: much more in conferences
‚Ä¢ Discussion of drug and alcohol problems: more in conferences.
6. Offenders Found Conferences More Stressful Than Court
‚Ä¢ Conferences are more emotionally intense for offenders than court
‚Ä¢ Drink drivers report significantly higher levels of embarrassment and shame from being
criticised in conferences than in court.
7. Most Victims Said Conferences Were Fairer Than Court
‚Ä¢ Victims' sense of restorative justice was higher among conference victims than court victims.
‚Ä¢ Victims sense of procedural fairness was high among conference victims, but not measurable
among court victims because they so rarely attended proceedings.
‚Ä¢ Healing of the victims' emotional harm was substantial among conference victims for both
property and violence cases.
‚Ä¢ Reconciliation of the victim and the offender was far greater in conference cases than in court
for both property and violence experiments
iv EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
‚Ä¢ Victims were less likely to fear repeat victimisation by the offender after conference cases than
after court cases.
‚Ä¢ Legitimacy of the law and respect for the police was mixed between different experiments.
Property victims reported higher respect for police after conference cases than after court cases,
although violence victims did not.
‚Ä¢ Satisfaction with the way their case was handled was somewhat greater for conference than
court cases among property victims, but there was no difference among violence victims.
8. Offenders Said Conferences Were Fairer Than Court
‚Ä¢ Offenders reported higher levels of most dimensions of procedural fairness after conferences
than after court.
‚Ä¢ Drink drivers saw the penalty as too hard more often in court than in conference, and were
more often angry after court.
‚Ä¢ Youth and juvenile offenders reported no less sense of retributive punishment in conference than
in court.
‚Ä¢ Offenders reported much higher levels of restorative justice, or the opportunity to repair the
harm they had caused by their crimes, after conferences than after court appearances.
‚Ä¢ Offenders reported more dimensions of reintegrative shaming after conferences than after
court, including a greater sense of forgiveness.
‚Ä¢ Offenders report little evidence of defiance in either treat",,"Police, Justice",Australian Federal Police,,,,,,,,,,,Original database,,,,Full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,The sample size is more than 1100 offenders.,The study does not explicitly mention statistically significant results in the provided description.

"Waters et al.,",An Exploratory Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial Of Knowledge Translation Strategies To Support Evidence-Informed Decision-Making In Local Governments (The Kt4lg Study),2011,"Background
Childhood overweight and obesity is the most prevalent and, arguably, politically complex child health problem internationally. Governments, communities and industry have important roles to play, and are increasingly expected to deliver an evidence-informed system-wide prevention program. However, efforts are impeded by a lack of organisational access to and use of research evidence. This study aims to identify feasible, acceptable and ideally, effective knowledge translation (KT) strategies to increase evidence-informed decision-making in local governments, within the context of childhood obesity prevention as a national policy priority.

Methods/Design
This paper describes the methods for KT4LG, a cluster randomised controlled trial which is exploratory in nature, given the limited evidence base and methodological advances. KT4LG aims to examine a program of KT strategies to increase the use of research evidence in informing public health decisions in local governments. KT4LG will also assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. The intervention program comprises a facilitated program of evidence awareness, access to tailored research evidence, critical appraisal skills development, networking and evidence summaries and will be compared to provision of evidence summaries alone in the control program. 28 local governments were randomised to intervention or control, using computer generated numbers, stratified by budget tertile (high, medium or low). Questionnaires will be used to measure impact, costs, and outcomes, and key informant interviews will be used to examine processes, feasibility, and experiences. Policy tracer studies will be included to examine impact of intervention on policies within relevant government policy documents.

Discussion
Knowledge translation intervention studies with a focus on public health and prevention are very few in number. Thus, this study will provide essential data on the experience of program implementation and evaluation of a system-integrated intervention program employed within the local government public health context. Standardised programs of system, organisational and individual KT strategies have not been described or rigorously evaluated. As such, the findings will make a significant contribution to understanding whether a facilitated program of KT strategies hold promise for facilitating evidence-informed public health decision making within complex multisectoral government organisations.",,"Public Health

Control Usual universal care.

Main outcome measures The quality of the home environment for child development (12–24 months), parent–child interaction and child mental, psychomotor and behavioural development at 18 months.

Results Mothers receiving the intervention were more emotionally and verbally responsive (HOME observation) during the first 2 years of their child's life than comparison group mothers (mean difference 0.5; 95% CI 0.1 to 0.9). Duration of breastfeeding was longer for intervention mothers than comparison mothers (mean difference 7.9 weeks; 95% CI 2.9 to 12.9). There was no significant difference in parent–child interaction between the intervention and comparison groups. There were no significant overall group differences in child mental, psychomotor or behavioural development. Mothers assessed antenatally as having psychosocial distress benefitted from the intervention across a number of areas.

Conclusion This sustained nurse home visiting programme showed trends to enhanced outcomes in many, but not all, areas. Specifically, it resulted in clinically enhanced outcomes in breastfeeding duration and, for some subgroups of mothers, women's experience of motherhood and children's mental development.",10.1136/adc.2010.196279,Health; Infant and maternal health,,,,,,,,,,,,Original database,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),208,"The study showed statistically significant results in some areas.

"Purcell et al.,",Is education an effective management strategy for reducing cancer-related fatigue?,2011,"Purpose
The use of education is recommended to teach patients self-care behaviours to reduce cancer-related fatigue, however, there is little evidence of its effectiveness or optimal timing. This educationally based cancer-related fatigue intervention trial, CAN-FIT, aimed to reduced severity of fatigue in radiotherapy patients.

Methods
One hundred and ten participants aged ≥18 years undergoing curative radiotherapy were randomly assigned to receive (1) pre- and post-radiotherapy fatigue education and support (RFES); (2) pre-RFES only; (3) post-RFES only; or (4) no RFES (standard care). Data collection occurred at pre- and post- radiotherapy and at 6-weeks follow-up.

Results
The intervention was not associated with reduction in fatigue levels at any assessment point. Significant changes were seen with secondary activity-based outcomes: Physical activity participation: Pre-RFES was associated with significantly greater increase in vigorous [Assessment (Ax)1-Ax2: 1.05 (0.24, 1.86) p < 0.01: Ax2–Ax3: 1.24, (0.44, 2.03) p < 0.01] and moderate physical activity participation [Ax1–Ax2: 1.4 (0.53, 2.26) p < 0.01]. Post-RFES was associated with significant improvements in walking levels [Ax1–Ax3: 5.82 (0.07, 11.56) p < 0.05] compared with no pre-RFES. Paid and unpaid employment: Pre-RFES was associated with slower return to pre-treatment levels of paid work [Ax2–Ax3: −0.72 (−1.41, −0.04) p < 0.05] than no pre-RFES. Post-RFES was associated with decreased levels of unpaid work [Ax1–Ax3: 561.79 (51.21, 1,072.37) p < 0.05] compared with no post-RFES.

Conclusion
The CAN-FIT programme did not significantly improve the primary outcome, level of fatigue, regardless of when it was delivered, however, significant changes were observed in activity-based outcomes. Further investigations into educationally based programmes should target activity participation rather than changes in underlying fatigue to improve overall patient health.",10.1007/s00520-010-0970-2,Health,,,,,,,,,,,,Original database,,,,Full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,110,"The study did not show statistically significant results for the primary outcome of reducing cancer-related fatigue.

"Skouteris et al.,",Healthy Eating And Obesity Prevention For Preschoolers: A Randomised Controlled Trial,2010,"Background
Developing effective prevention and intervention programs for the formative preschool years is seen as an essential step in combating the obesity epidemic across the lifespan. The overall goal of the current project is to measure the effectiveness of a healthy eating and childhood obesity prevention intervention, the MEND (Mind Exercise Nutrition Do It!) program that is delivered to parents of children aged 2-4 years.
Methods/Design
This randomised controlled trial will be conducted with 200 parents and their 2-4 year old children who attend the MEND 2-4 program in metropolitan and regional Victoria. Parent-child dyads will attend ten 90-minute group workshops. These workshops focus on general nutrition, as well as physical activity and behaviours. They are typically held at community or maternal and child health centres and run by a MEND 2-4 trained program leader. Child eating habits, physical activity levels and parental behaviours and cognitions pertaining to nutrition and physical activity will be assessed at baseline, the end of the intervention, and at 6 and 12 months post the intervention. Informed consent will be obtained from all parents, who will then be randomly allocated to the intervention or wait-list control group.
Discussion
Our study is the first RCT of a healthy eating and childhood obesity prevention intervention targeted specifically to Australian parents and their preschool children aged 2-4 years. It responds to the call by experts in the area of childhood obesity and child health that prevention of overweight in the formative preschool years should focus on parents, given that parental beliefs, attitudes, perceptions and behaviours appear to impact significantly on the development of early overweight. This is 'solution-oriented' rather than 'problem-oriented' research, with its focus being on prevention rather than intervention. If this is a positive trial, the MEND2-4 program can be implemented as a national program.",10.1186/1471-2458-10-220,Education; Public Health,,,,,,,,,,,,Original database,,,,This is a protocol / pre-analysis plan.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,200,I'm unsure.

"Joachim et al.,","Reducing Preschoolers‚Äô Disruptive Behaviour 
in Public with a Brief Parent Discussion Group",2009,"Background
Interventions to promote positive parenting are often reported to offer good outcomes for children but they can consume substantial resources and they require rigorous appraisal.
Methods
Evaluations of the Triple P parenting program were subjected to systematic review and meta-analysis with analysis of biases. PsychInfo, Embase and Ovid Medline were used as data sources. We selected published articles reporting any child-based outcome in which any variant of Triple P was evaluated in relation to a comparison condition. Unpublished data, papers in languages other than English and some book chapters were not examined. Studies reporting Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory or Child Behavior Checklist scores as outcomes were used in the meta-analysis.
Results
A total of 33 eligible studies was identified, most involving media-recruited families. Thirty-one of these 33 studies compared Triple P interventions with waiting list or no-treatment comparison groups. Most papers only reported maternal assessments of child behavior. Twenty-three papers were incorporated in the meta-analysis. No studies involved children younger than two-years old and comparisons of intervention and control groups beyond the duration of the intervention were only possible in five studies. For maternally-reported outcomes the summary effect size was 0.61 (95%CI 0.42, 0.79). Paternally-reported outcomes following Triple P intervention were smaller and did not differ significantly from the control condition (effect size 0.42 (95%CI -0.02, 0.87)). The two studies involving an active control group showed no between-group differences. There was limited evidence of publication bias, but there was substantial selective reporting bias, and preferential reporting of positive results in article abstracts. Thirty-two of the 33 eligible studies were authored by Triple-P affiliated personnel. No trials were registered and only two papers contained conflict of interest statements.
Conclusions
In volunteer populations over the short term, mothers generally report that Triple P group interventions are better than no intervention, but there is concern about these results given the high risk of bias, poor reporting and potential conflicts of interest. We found no convincing evidence that Triple P interventions work across the whole population or that any benefits are long-term. Given the substantial cost implications, commissioners should apply to parenting programs the standards used in assessing pharmaceutical interventions.

Design Cluster randomised trial.

Setting 40 primary care nursing centres (clusters) in Victoria, Australia.

Participants 733 English speaking mothers of 8 month old children sequentially recruited from well child appointments; 656 retained at 24 months.

Intervention Structured three session programme at age 8-15 months, co-led by well child providers and a parenting expert. The programme covered normal development and behaviour, strategies to increase desired behaviour, and strategies to reduce unwanted behaviour.

Main outcome measures Maternal report of child externalising behaviour (child behavior checklist 1½-5 year old), parenting (parent behavior checklist), and maternal mental health (depression anxiety stress scales) at 18 and 24 months.

Results At 18 months, child behaviour and parenting scores were similar in the two groups. At 24 months, externalising scores in the intervention and control groups were similar (mean 11.9 (SD 7.2) v 12.9 (7.4)); however, on the parent behavior checklist subscale scores, intervention group parents were less likely to report harsh/abusive parenting (mean 38.9 (SD 7.7) v 40.5 (8.8); adjusted mean difference −1.83, 95% confidence interval −3.12 to −0.55) and unreasonable expectations of child development (40.9 (9.9) v 42.7 (9.6); −2.18, −3.74 to −0.62).

To evaluate the effectiveness of a program to increase walking to and from school.
Design
A cluster randomised controlled trial.
Setting
24 primary public schools in inner west Sydney, Australia.
Participants
1996 students aged 10–12 years and their parents.
Intervention
A two-year multi-component program included classroom activities, development of school Travel Access Guides, parent newsletters and improving environments with local councils.
Measures
Two measures were used: a survey completed by students on how they travelled to and from school over five days, and a survey completed by their parents on how their child travelled to and from school in a usual week.
Results
The percentage of students who walked to and from school increased in both the intervention and control schools. Data from parent surveys found that 28.8% of students in the intervention group increased their walking, compared with 19% in the control group (a net increase of 9.8%, p = 0.05). However this effect was not evident in the student data.

Parents of children aged 2 to 8 years were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: the usual Group Triple P program, consisting of four group sessions and four telephone calls (n = 16); a modified Group Triple P condition, consisting of just the four group sessions (n = 17); or a waitlist control condition (n = 16). Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted using the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and the Parenting Scale (PS). Statistically and clinically significant main effects were found for attending either the full Triple P or the modified Triple P program on both the DASS and the ECBI, but not on the participant's perception of their parenting style (PS).

Method: A population‐based randomised controlled trial using linked hospital, cancer and death records to evaluate outcomes in 620 intervention and 6,736 control subjects.
Results: The intervention group had a higher rate of first‐time hospitalisation for any reason (IRR=1.37; 95% Cl 1.25‐1.50), a higher rate of injury‐related hospital episodes (IRR=1.31; 95% Cl 1.15‐1.48) and a higher notification rate of alcoholrelated cancers There was a smaller difference in the rates of multiple hospitalisations (IRR=1.14; 95% Cl 0.75‐1.74) and no improvement in overall mortality compared with controls (IRR=1.08; 95% Cl 0.91‐1.29).
Conclusions: There was no overall mortality benefit despite increased health service contact associated with the intervention.

"Cross et al.,",Australia: The Friendly Schools project,2004,"In Australia, approximately 1 in 6 school students reports being bullied at least once a week, and 1 in 20 reports bullying others in the past 6 months (Rigby, 1997; Zubrick et al., 1997). Slee and Rigby (1993; Slee, 1995) found that while most of these episodes of bullying last for a day or two, 17% last for 6 months or more. Australian primary-school children of both genders report being bullied more often than secondary-school students, with more boys than girls bullying others and being bullied (Rigby and Slee, 1991; Rigby, 1997; Rigby and Slee, 1998).

Despite Australian schools' increasing need systematically to address bullying, prior to 1999 no system-level, evidence-based recommendations or state curriculum materials to help to reduce bullying were available. Many school staff reported that they were unsure of the effectiveness of the strategies they utilised, and often did not know what actions could be taken at a whole-school level to reduce, or prevent, the harm from student bullying.

In response to this situation, in 1999, the Curtin University, Western Australian Centre for Health Promotion Research, applied for and received funding extensively to review and synthesise international published empirical and theoretical evidence of successful school-based strategies to reduce the harm experienced by children from being bullied or bullying others.

Those in the treatment groups were asked to attend an initial interview to help them plan for the future and were then referred to other forms of assistance that might help them to realise their plans. Using different estimators and several indicators of outcomes, the evidence for the program having a positive effect on outcomes is very weak.The reason for this result is explored by an analysis of the relationships between the plans participants formulated, the barriers they faced and whether they left benefits. It is found that while the program encouraged claimants to plan for moving into paid work, the assistance offered did not reduce the barriers they faced.",10.1002/j.1839-4655.2004.tb01192.x,Parenting; Welfare payments; Social services,"Centrelink, Fed.

Bogossian,The Mothers‚Äô Health Study‚ÄØ: A Randomised Controlled Trial Of A Social Support Intervention On The Health Of Mothers In The Year After Birth,2004,"The duration of the postnatal period is professionally and socially defined as extending to six weeks after birth. After this time the mother is presumed to have recovered from pregnancy and birth and can fully resume her roles. Yet up to 94% of mothers report ongoing health concerns six months after birth (Brown & Lumley, 1998) and these concerns may persist for years (MacArthur, Lewis, & Knox, 1991b). Postnatal maternal morbidity is largely hidden, it is under-reported by mothers, remains untreated, and is neglected in the provision of maternity services. Given that in Australia, over a quarter of a million women give birth each year (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2003) the potential impact of ongoing health problems for women and their families represents a serious public health problem. This study sought to address two fundamental questions. Firstly, what is the nature, extent, severity and duration of maternal morbidity in the year after childbirth? And secondly, can social support improve maternal morbidity in the year following birth? 

A randomised controlled trial was performed in Ipswich and Redcliffe/Caboolture Health Districts of Queensland, Australia to determine the effect of a programme of postnatal emotional social support provided by Research Midwives on the prevalence, severity and duration of maternal health concerns in the first year after birth. One hundred and thirty five women gave informed consent to participate in the trial, and these women were eligible for inclusion, as they had all given birth to live term infants during the specified recruitment period. Simple randomisation was performed resulting in balanced groups. The retention rates at completion of the trial were 71% and 61% for the intervention and control groups respectively. 

The intervention was a programme of home visits and telephone calls by, and twenty-four hour telephone access to. Research Midwives and was aimed at providing emotional social support to women. Only anxiety status appeared to be affected by the intervention with significantly more women in the intervention group remaining non-personally disturbed than in the control group at the post intervention point in time (x2.6.31, df 2, p<0.04). The intervention did not demonstrate an effect on the perceived social support, on the prevalence, nature and severity of health concerns, or on postnatal depression reported by women. The majority of women (87.7%) in the intervention group were compliant with the programme of support, however the analysis was performed on an intention to treat basis. 

Women experienced diminished general health after birth and this persisted with respect to the Role-Physical (t=-2.75, df 88, p=0.007) and Vitality (t=-4.54, df 89, p<0.001) transformed scales of the SF-36 at fifty-two weeks postpartum. Thirteen health concerns were prevalent in greater than twenty percent of women at both points in time and the severity of concerns remained stable between two and twelve months postpartum. Of the mothers who reported health concerns, 40-78% did not seek professional advice and the majority did not undertake any treatment. 

Extreme tiredness was the most prevalent health concern and persisted to affect 58.1% of mothers at twelve months. Urinary incontinence was the only concern that increased in prevalence over the study period from 35.3% at eight weeks to 46.0% at fifty-two weeks postpartum. Painful perineum and haemorrhoids were significantly associated with assisted vaginal delivery, specifically, painful perineum (OR 9.55) at eight weeks postpartum and haemorrhoids at both eight and fifty-two weeks postpartum (OR 8.80 and OR 12.00). Mothers who described the birth as ""difficult"" at fifty-two weeks were more likely to report sexual difficulties (OR 7.00). 

Method of delivery was significantly associated with pelvic health concerns at eight weeks (χ2 9.20, df 2, p=0.010) and fifty-two weeks (χ2 7.86, df 2, p=0.020) and with bowel concerns at eight weeks (χ2 10.93, df2, p=0.004). Primiparas were more likely to report sexual difficulties at eight weeks (χ2 6.44, df 3, p=0.040). 

Women with persistent neck or shoulder pain at eight and fifty-two weeks (OR 3.46 and OR 2.80) or bowel problems at eight weeks (OR 2.70) were more likely to have lower Mental Component Summary scores. At fifty-two weeks those mothers who had urinary frequency (OR 5.10), bowel problems (OR 7.32), extreme tiredness (OR 9.51), or teeth or gum problems (OR 4.62) were more likely to have lower Physical Component Summary scores. 

The presumption that social support declines over time was supported by the trend that fewer women reported increased support and more women reported diminished support. While this trend was significant for emotional social support (McNemar's p=0.009) it was evident for informational and functional subscales of social support. While the social support intervention did not produce a statistically significant effect, no negative impacts were demonstrated. The experiences of the key stakeholders in the study provide evidence of the positive non-quantifiable outcomes of study involvement. The positive impact of social support was evident in that women who reported high levels of social support reported low levels of health concern severity and this trend was significant for informational support (χ2 6.48, df 88, p<0.01). Postnatal depression and anxiety were also associated with high health concern severity; the latter was significantly associated (χ2 19.63, df=124, p<0.01). High levels of emotional social support and low levels of anxiety appeared to enhance mental health measured by the Mental Component Summary score. 

The results of the study are unlikely to be attributed to bias or confounding and appear to be generalisable to other populations of pregnant women who exhibit the same maternal and birth characteristics and fulfil the eligibility criteria. The extent and persistent nature of, and lack of treatment seeking behaviour for ongoing health concerns in the postpartum year strongly supports the urgent need for systematic data collection and appropriate screening of women postpartum. When the results of this study are examined in light of existing research, it provides increasing support for the need for more focused research trials, and for social support interventions to be targeted to those groups who have diminished social resources.",10.14264/254235,Health; Infant and maternal health,,,,,,,,,,,,Original database,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,135,"The study showed statistically significant results in a few areas.

Dolan,A Randomised Controlled Trial Of Methadone Maintenance Treatment In NSW Prisons,2003,"Evidence of the effectiveness of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in reducing heroin injection and HIV infection among injecting drug users (IDUs) in community settings has been well documented (Ward et al, 1998). However, many IDUs spend time in prison where approximately half continue to inject and typically share syringes (Butler et al, 1997). Yet few countries operate methadone maintenance programs for IDUs in prison.

This report documents a randomised controlled study of the NSW prison methadone program. Over 923 inmates were screened for suitability for participation in the trial. Of these, 593 were suitable and 382 agreed to take part in the study. The 382 subjects were interviewed, asked to provide a finger prick blood sample and a hair sample at recruitment and four months later. The blood samples were tested for hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV antibodies. The hair samples were tested for the presence of morphine.

Baseline characteristics: At baseline, subjects in both groups were comparable on all key demographic characteristics, prison histories, injecting drug use and sharing of injecting equipment in prison and in the community. Both groups had the same mean age (27 years), mean age first imprisoned (20 years), had been imprisoned a mean four (treated) and five (control) times, started injecting at mean age 17 years, and commenced daily injecting at mean age 19 (treated) and 18 (control) years. A quarter of both groups were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander (22%, 25%). Median length of current sentence was 1.4 years in both the treated (range 0.3-18) and control (range 0.2-21) group. The treated group was significantly more likely to report having shared syringes at some time in the community (76% vs 64%) while comparable proportions of both groups who had injected in prison reported sharing syringes (92%, 87%).

Drug use: Virtually all inmates reported injecting in the month before they entered prison (98% treated, 93% control). The most common drug injected prior to prison entry was heroin (96% treated, 90% control) followed by amphetamine (40%, 40%), cocaine (34%, 35%) and illicitly obtained methadone (26%, 23%). Most inmates in the treated group (69%) and the control group (74%) who had been in prison at least one month before being recruited into the study reported injecting heroin in prison.

Self reported HIV, HCV and HBV prevalence: No-one reported being HIV positive at entry to the study (it should be noted that this was an exclusion criterion for the study). Almost two thirds of treated (64%) and control (63%) subjects reported a previous positive hepatitis C result while one fifth (22%, 19%) of treated and control subjects reported positive hepatitis B (HBV) results. Approximately half of both groups reported having been vaccinated against HBV (49%, 48%).

HIV and HCV seroprevalence: Finger prick blood samples were assayed using an algorithm that has high correlation with assays of venous blood samples (NCCLS, 1998). HIV antibody was detected using Genetic Systems HIV-1 ELISA tests. HCV antibody was detected using a modified third generation enzyme immunoassay (Abbott HCV 3.0, Chicago II). The blood test results revealed 76% of treated and 72% of control subjects had antibodies to hepatitis C. No blood spot samples test positive for HIV.

Hair tests: Quantitative results for hair analysis (nanograms per mg of hair) were analysed. Hair samples were tested for morphine, the metabolite of heroin in the body, by Tricho- Tech Limited, Wales, UK. At baseline, one cm of hair cut from the root was analysed for morphine to assess heroin use in the previous month. The prevalence of morphine positive samples was 82% for the treated group and 83% for controls.

Follow up: The aim was to re- interview after a period of four months. Of the 382 subjects recruited into the trial, follow-up interviews were completed for 313 (82%). The rest were unavailable for follow up because they had been released from prison, declined to be re- interviewed or were incapable. Of the 162 (85%) treated and 152 (80%) control subjects who were re- interviewed, approximately one fifth (20%, 18%) of each group had been released and re-incarcerated between interviews and were excluded from main analysis. As the aim of the study was to assess the impact of methadone maintenance treatment on heroin use, syringe sharing and the prevention of blood borne viral infection (BBVI) in prison, only the 253 subjects who received a second interview and who had remained in prison are included in the current analysis. Therefore 129 (68%) of treated and 124 (65%) of control subjects who had been in continuous custody were included in the analysis for the purposes this report. The mean time period between interviews was 5.2 months for treated and 4.5 months for control subjects.

Drug use: Self- reported use of any illicit drug between interviews remained high at in both the treated and control group. At follow up, a three cm segment of hair was cut from the root, divided into three one cm sections and analysed for morphine to assess heroin use in each of the three months preceding the follow up interview. Hair samples reflecting the first month after recruitment were not tested. This month allowed inmates on methadone to reach an adequate dose (eg 60mg). When determined by both hair morphine concentration and self report, heroin use was significantly lower in the treated group at month two, three and four of follow up compared to the control group. Treated subjects also reported a significantly lower mean number of heroin injections in each month of follow up compared to controls.

Needle and syringe sharing: Treated subjects reported significantly less needle and syringe sharing at follow up compared to control subjects. There was no difference in the median number of sharing partners reported by treated compared to control subjects.

Seroconversion: Four subjects in both groups seroconverted to HCV. No one seroconverted to HIV.

Sexual risk behaviour: One ethics committee precluded questions about sexual activity from the first interview. However sexually contact with others was rarely report at follow up (2% treatment, 2% control) and no sexual behaviour was reported with other inmates.

Conclusion: The study demonstrated that it is possible to conduct a randomised control trial of a prison methadone program. The groups were comparable at baseline. At follow up, the treatment group had benefited from being on methadone as they reported less heroin use, less injecting and less syringe sharing. Combined results from hair analysis and self report also showed less heroin use among the treated group. There were equal numbers of HCV seroconversions and no HIV seroconversions.",,"Crime

A total of 63 parents were recruited for the study with 45 parents (40 mothers and 5 fathers) from 40 families completing the project. The research design permitted comparison between the intervention and three alternative conditions with all parents receiving the intervention in an alternating sequence over the life of the project. The intervention consisted of 10 weekly lessons carried out in the parent’s home focusing on child health and home safety. The program was adapted to suit the Australian context from the UCLA Parent–Child Health and Wellness Project (Tymchuk, Groen, & Dolyniuk, 2000). Outcome measures assessed parental health and safety behaviours. Standard measures included parental health, intelligence and literacy. The intervention improved parents’ ability to recognize home dangers, to identify precautions to deal with these dangers and resulted in a significant increase in the number of safety precautions parents implemented in their homes with all gains being maintained at 3 months post-intervention. Parents’ health behaviours including improved understanding of health and symptoms of illness, knowledge of and skills needed to manage life-threatening emergencies, knowledge about visiting the doctor, knowing when to call, what information to provide and what questions to ask, and how to use medicines safely significantly increased. Again, all gains were maintained 3 months post-intervention. The intervention was effective regardless of parental health, literacy skills, and IQ.

To evaluate the relative efficacy of (1) child therapy, (2) parent/teacher training, and (3) the combination of child therapy and parent/teacher training in the treatment of anxiety-based school refusal.
Method

Sixty-one school-refusing children (aged 7–14 years) from throughout Melbourne, Australia, were randomized to a child therapy program, a parent and teacher training program, or a combination of the two. Children were assessed before and after treatment, and at 4.5-month follow-up, by means of attendance records, self-report of emotional distress and self-efficacy, parent and teacher reports of emotional distress, and clinician ratings of overall functioning.
Results

Statistically and clinically significant pretreatment-posttreatment change occurred for each group. Immediately posttreatment, child therapy appeared to be the least effective in increasing attendance. By follow-up, the attendance and adjustment of those in the child therapy group equalled that of children whose parents and teachers were involved in treatment, whether on their own (parent/ teacher training) or together with their children (combined child therapy and parent/teacher training).

comparison of enhanced, standard, and self-directed 
behavioural family intervention for parents of children with early onset conduct problems.",2000,"Although many people with psychosis are parents, managing the dual demands of poor mental health and parenting can be stressful and may contribute to poorer outcomes for both parent and child. Parenting interventions have the potential to improve outcomes for the whole family but need evaluation of feasibility in this context. The Triple-P Self-Help Workbook was implemented with guidance and support with 10 parents experiencing psychosis in a multiple baseline case series study. Sessions were weekly and home-based. Outcome measures examined facets of parenting, child behavior, self-efficacy and parental mental health. Follow up interviews explored parents' perspectives of the perceived impact of the intervention and apparent mechanisms of change. The program resulted in clinically significant change (&gt;25% improvement) in mental health, parenting and child behavior measures post-intervention for the 50% who completed all 10 sessions and improvements were maintained at 3 and 6 month follow up. Interviews with those who completed the program revealed it to have been transformative: parents reported positive changes in parenting style; they were empowered with regard to their parenting and had a greater sense of control over their mental health. This study provides preliminary evidence that self-directed Triple P might be able to reduce the symptoms of psychosis by improving family functioning.

Compared to the control group, parents in the television viewing (TV) condition reported significantly lower levels of disruptive child behavior and higher levels of perceived parenting competence, immediately following intervention. Prior to intervention approximately 42.9% of the children in the TV condition were in the clinically elevated range for disruptive child behavioral problems. This had reduced to 14.3% following intervention. In addition, a high level of consumer acceptability was reported by parents in the TV condition. All post-intervention effects were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Implications for public health approaches to family mental health are discussed.

To test the cost effectiveness of Hospital in the Home compared to hospital admission for acute medical conditions.
METHOD
Randomised controlled trial at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, from October 1995 to February, 1997; 100 patients with acute medical conditions admitted through the Emergency Department.
RESULTS
The Hospital in the Home (HITH) group costs per separation ($1,764, CI95%$1,416 -$2,111, n=50) were significantly lower (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U -Wilcoxon Rank Sum) than the control group hospital separation ($3,614, CI 95%$2,881.37 -$4,347.27, n=47) with no significant difference in clinical outcomes, and comparable or better user satisfaction.
CONCLUSION
Given the favourable clinical outcomes the HITH model produces at a lower cost, the cost-effectiveness of the care mode is high, and the allocative efficiency favourable.

"Mitchell et al.,",A Randomised Trial Of An Intervention To Develop Health Promoting Schools In Australia: The South Western Sydney Study,2000,"OBJECTIVE
This paper describes the evaluation of a health promoting schools intervention carried out in the south western region of Sydney, Australia. The evaluation sought to assess the project's impact on structures to support the health promoting school concept and changes in health-related policies and practices within 22 local schools.
METHODS
A randomised controlled study was employed. Intervention schools were offered seminars and training in the health promoting schools concept, encouraged to use a resource kit to help them establish their school as health promoting and invited to participate in a support network. Pre- and post measures of awareness, school structures and policies and practices to support the development of a health promoting school were taken and intervention and control schools compared.
RESULTS
There was an increased level of awareness of the health promoting school concept among intervention schools. However, there were no significant changes in health-related policies and practices at the school level, among both intervention and control schools.
CONCLUSIONS
A longer time frame and more structured support are required to influence school structures to support the development of a health promoting school.
IMPLICATIONS
To facilitate organisational change in schools, health promoting school interventions need to provide structured support for schools and recognise that change takes time. A committee to initiate action, a plan to guide work and school support are likely to facilitate the adoption of the health promoting schools approach. Further work to refine the measurement of school-based action and its outcome and the development of indicators for a health promoting school is needed.",10.1111/j.1467-842x.2000.tb01563.x,"Public Health

"Peel et al.,",Home Safety Assessment In The Prevention Of Falls Among Older People,2000,"Objective
Home safety assessment was examined as part of a randomised trial of falls prevention interventions among older community dwellers.
Method
Falls prevention strategies, including education and awareness-raising, exercise, home modifications and medical assessment, were trialled with 252 members of the National Seniors Association. Falls outcomes were monitored using a daily calendar diary during intervention and follow-up periods.
Results
The home assessment group was significantly more likely to modify their home environment than the controls (p<0.0001). Participants, regardless of group allocation, reported a significant reduction in concern about falling (p<0.0001). During the intervention, the home assessment group had lower incidence rates for falls and injuries than the control group, although differences were not significant. The lowered rates were sustained post-intervention.
Conclusions
While the effect on falls incidence of a home safety intervention on its own could not be demonstrated, other benefits, including improved confidence attributable to awareness of such falls prevention measures, were recorded.

"Fraser et al.,",Home Visiting Intervention For Vulnerable Families With Newborns: Follow-Up Results Of A Randomised Controlled Trial,2000,"Objective: This study aimed to: (1) Assess the community utility of a screening tool to identify families with child abuse or neglect risk factors in the immediate postnatal period (2) Determine the social validity and effectiveness of a home visiting program using community child health nurses and offering social work services for identified families, and (3) Identify factors in the immediate postnatal period associated with the child’s environment that predict poor adjustment to the parenting role.
Method: A randomized controlled trial using a cohort of 181 families was undertaken to evaluate the impact of a home visiting program. Mothers were recruited in the immediate postnatal period and allocated either into the home visiting program or into a comparison group. The research design required self-identification into the study by providing positive responses to a range of risk factors. A repeated measures design was used to test parenting stress and maternal depression from the immediate postnatal period to 12-month follow-up and physical child abuse potential to 18-month follow-up. To test whether measures taken in the immediate postnatal period were predictive for poor adjustment to the parenting role, a linear regression model was used.
Results: The screening procedure was shown to have utility in the context of recruitment to a research trial and mothers were willing to accept the home visiting program examined by this study from the immediate postnatal period. From as early as 6 weeks the program demonstrated ability to impact positively on maternal, infant, family, and home environment variables (testing 90 randomly allocated intervention vs. 91 comparison families). At follow-up, parental adjustment variables were not significantly different between groups (testing the remaining 68 (75.5%) intervention vs. 70 (76.9%) comparison families) and home environment assessment scores had converged. Predictive analysis of factors measured in the immediate postnatal period revealed an absence of any predictive value to demographic characteristics, which secondary prevention efforts typically target.
Conclusions: Follow-up evaluation did not demonstrate a positive impact on parenting stress, parenting competence, or quality of the home environment confirming the need to test early program success on longer term outcomes. Further, the study not only demonstrated that there was a relationship between maternal, family and environmental factors identified in the immediate postnatal period, and adjustment to the parenting role, but also challenged demographic targeting for child abuse and neglect risk. At the same time, the immediate postnatal period presented an exciting window of opportunity to access high-risk families who may otherwise have become marginalized from traditional services.",10.1016/s0145-2134(00)00193-9,"Welfare

"Schofield et al.,",Interventions With Retailers To Reduce Cigarette Sales To Minors: A Randomised Controlled Trial,1997,"Abstract: We aimed to determine the relative effectiveness of an education intervention and a threat-of-enforcement intervention in reducing sales of cigarettes to under-age youth by randomly allocating 300 retailers in a nonmetropolitan region of New South Wales to: a control group with no intervention; a minimal-intervention group, which received an educational letter; and a maximal-intervention group, which received a threat of enforcement followed by a visit from a public health officer. Retailers were checked for compliance at pretest and post-test, six months apart, by twelve 18-yearolds who were judged by independent raters to look younger. The retailers were surveyed by telephone at both times for knowledge, attitudes and self-reported sales practices. Neither intervention achieved significant improvements for the two key behavioural outcomes: requiring proof of age and display of a warning sign. Neither was there an intervention effect on knowledge about the law. The greatest improvement in the proportion of retailers who believed that the legal age should be 18 or over was in the minimal-intervention group, and both intervention groups were less likely than the control group at post-test to think that it was acceptable to sell to a person who was nearly 18. There was poor overall compliance with the revised legislation at pre-test. The finding of a pretest-to-post-test improvement but no differential intervention effect highlights the methodological difficulties of such research. The interventions may, however, have been pardy successful in modifying the attitudes of retailers.

Greaves,The effect of rational-emotive parent education on the stress of mothers of children with Down Syndrome,1997,"Parents of children with disabilities are likely to experience more stress than parents of normal children. This study assessed the effectiveness of a Rational-Emotive Parent Education Program (REPE) in reducing parental stress. The REPE program focused only on core irrationalities to determine the efficacy of elegant disputation. Mothers of young children attending an early intervention centre for Down syndrome were randomly allocated to three groups, experimental, REPE, n = 21; a comparative-treatment control, Applied Behaviour Analysis, (ABA) n = 17; and a no-treatment control, n = 16. A pretest post-test design was used with there being eight seminars of both the REPE and ABA programs. On both the Profile of Mood States and the Parenting Stress Index (Parent Domain) totals the REPE group showed significant reductions in stress compared with both control groups. The results from some subscales and single items suggested that the early intervention centre program also reduced stress. The REPE program using elegant disputation reduced parental stress.

In the group that received letters, 56 per cent were screened without a reminder compared with 43 per cent of the group that did not receive letters (P = 0.01). Fewer women who received letters from their general practitioners declined the invitation to be screened (P = 0.048). In the second trial, there was no difference in participation between the group receiving telephone reminders and the group receiving postal reminders.

For the fathers and mothers of children with disabilities, psychological health and well‐being was assessed on the General Health Questionnaire, using a pretest and follow‐up control group design. Results showed a statistically significant difference between groups, 12 months after treatment, with program participants displaying less emotional distress than control group subjects. The positive direction of behavioural and attitudinal outcomes, which emerged from evaluation of the small group intervention, were similar for both mothers and fathers. Overall satisfaction with the program was very high, with useful recommendations for program development and for future research and practice being identified.

AERO & Anne Kennedy,Research gives insight into the power of early years education to improve outcomes for Australia‚Äôs most vulnerable children,2021,"By the time they start school, gaps are already apparent between children from advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds. In learning and cognition as well as social and emotional development, the gaps may increase without effective and costly later intervention.

In 2007, the Children‚Äôs Protection Society (CPS, now trading as Kids First), a child and family services agency, as well as a group of researchers from the University of Melbourne embarked on a bold and innovative research project. 

The Early Years Education Research Program (EYERP) brought together professionals with expertise in economics, statistical analysis, clinical research methodologies, social work, infant mental health, project management and early childhood curriculum and pedagogy.

The research project aimed to test the hypothesis that a 3-year, high-quality, early education program for young children living with severe family stress and social disadvantage, would enable them to enter school as confident learners, developmentally and educationally equal to their peers. The project was innovative and bold in several ways.

The project was designed as a randomised controlled trial (RCT), a design rarely used in early childhood education in Australia. RCTs are helpful because they generate rigorous evidence of the effectiveness of an approach. As part of the RCT, children were assessed before, during and after the program.

The program being studied specifically targeted families and children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Some researchers have suggested that targeted approaches may not be effective because families and children from disadvantaged backgrounds may feel marginalised or face difficulties accessing affordable, high-quality early childhood programs.

Our research showed that this was not the case. Retention rates for families and children in our research project were high. Importantly, after 24 months of the intervention, there were large positive impacts on children‚Äôs cognitive and non-cognitive development ‚Äì primarily IQ, where there was an average 7 to 8 points improvement from below average to average.

Positive impacts were also identified with protective factors related to resilience and social-emotional development. There was also some evidence that the approach improves children‚Äôs language skills and lowers the psychological distress of their primary caregivers. These findings can be trusted because of rigor in the research design and commitment to program fidelity.

The power of the EYERP is that it provides greater insight into the characteristics of high-quality education and care. This evidence supports implementing practices that will help improve outcomes for children experiencing severe family stress and social disadvantage.

Achieving remarkable outcomes for children in the intervention group in the RCT is just the beginning for this research project. Our next phase aims to replicate the approach in several new sites to determine if the same outcomes can be achieved with similar cohorts of children.

Replication with fidelity is often the missing link in early education research interventions. We need to replicate to confirm that the approach works in different contexts; to identify evidence-informed modifications to the approach, and to make recommendations to government for a stepped scaling up of the approach.

Education equity gaps demand that we do something bold, evidence informed, and much earlier for children living with significant social disadvantage and family stress factors.",,Education,,,,,,,,,Research gives insig...~https://www.edresearch.edu.au/other/articles/early-years-education-improve-outcomes,,,,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Results were similar for men in priority populations (including men living in rural and remote areas and men from CALD backgrounds) and also applied to anxiety symptoms.
A higher number of Better Access treatment sessions during the COVID-19 period (2020‚Äì22) also did not appear to lead to improvements in depression symptoms during this period.

BETA & Department of Human Services,Effective use of SMS to encourage timely reporting behaviour using digital channels,2018,"BETA joined forces with the Australian Government Department of Human Services to help
job seekers report on time and receive their income support payments on time.
For Australians looking for work, Newstart Allowance and Youth Allowance (other) are the
main payments provided by the Australian Government. In 2016, these payments totalled
$10.95 billion. People who receive these payments must report their income every fortnight
to ensure they receive the correct payment. In any given fortnight over 80,000 people
(or 9 per cent) are late reporting their income and approximately 3,100 people are so late
their payments are cancelled.
Drawing on behavioural insights, we designed a trial to test if a simple and timely reminder could
make a difference. Australians live increasingly busy lives and make hundreds of decisions a
day. It can be easy to get distracted, or procrastinate and forget even the smallest and simplest
of tasks. Reminders have been shown to work in a range of contexts including healthcare,
education, financial management, and family welfare, and are often used by the private sector to
prompt on‚Äëtime payment of bills, and renewals of products and services.
Because we know people can respond differently depending on how a message is framed, we
also tested whether different reminder messages worked better than others. We designed three
types of SMS reminders sent the day before the income report was due: a short and simple
reminder (short group); a reminder emphasising the costs of not reporting (loss frame); and a
reminder making the benefits of reporting on time more salient (gain frame). We also sent each
message in a personalised and non-personalised version.
We tracked and measured the effect these messages had on income reporting and then
compared these results with people who did not receive a reminder. We found sending any
SMS reminder had a big impact, increasing the number of people who reported on time by
13.5 percentage points, with those who received an SMS reminder reporting sooner than
those who did not. Some reminders also resulted in fewer payment cancellations (down
by 1.7 percentage points).
The findings of our trial are clear: small, simple changes in service delivery make a big difference.
Introducing a simple reminder helps those looking for work to receive the income they need,
when they need it. These changes also help other Australians. By improving the efficiency
of services, resourcing can be redirected to helping others in need. In the context of Human
Services‚Äô 200 million interactions with Australians each year, these small improvements matter

BETA & Treasury,Supporting retirees in retirement income planning,2016,"This study examined how people respond to a new income plan for retirement, known as a Comprehensive Income 
Product for Retirement (CIPR). A CIPR is a composite retirement income product which is intended to provide a 
balance of income, risk management (for example, longevity risk management) and flexibility to retirees. In response 
to a Financial System Inquiry1
 recommendation, the Government has agreed to facilitate superannuation trustees 
pre-selecting a CIPR for their members at retirement. This study is a first step in building an evidence base to inform 
decisions about how best to present CIPRs to superannuation members in order to maximize comprehension, assist 
informed decision-making and alleviate cognitive load. Using insights from behavioural economics, we designed and 
tested a series of alternative presentations of information using a survey experiment based on a hypothetical CIPR. 
Over 3,600 pre-retirement members across five industry and retail superannuation funds participated in the study. 
Members were asked to review information which compared a CIPR and an Account-Based Pension (ABP) (which is 
how most retirees currently manage their superannuation in retirement). Members were randomly assigned to view 
information about the two plans in one of eight conditions ‚Äì minimal text descriptions (control); graphs showing 
estimates of income and assets over time; number tables showing numerical estimates of income and assets; text 
tables with text-based comparisons of income and assets; text tables with star ratings assigned to the plans and 
text-based comparisons of income and assets; and alternative versions of the text and number tables in which 
comparisons of income under each plan were highlighted in bold.
The results show that presenting key information in a relatively simple manner helped people to make the decision 
(as measured by comprehension, perceived clarity, decision-making ease and confidence), and made them more 
likely to choose the CIPR. Compared with the control group who viewed minimal text descriptions of the two 
plans, members who received any of the alternative information presentations, on average, exhibited much higher 
comprehension scores (3.71 compared to 2.67 out of 5 ‚Äì a 39% improvement), reported greater perceived clarity 
(3.74 vs 3.50 ‚Äì a 6.9% improvement), decision-making ease (3.54 vs 3.42 ‚Äì a 3.5% improvement), and decision 
confidence (3.50 vs 3.40 ‚Äì a 2.9% improvement), they also were more likely to choose the CIPR (52.01% vs 47.56% - 
a 9.4% improvement).
When comparing different types of presentations, text tables comparing the key features in words, rather than 
numbers alone, were consistently most effective. Tables showing numerical estimates appear to be least effective 
in general. Including star ratings or highlighting income comparisons across the plans had no impact on decisionmaking. If we were to declare an overall ‚Äúwinner‚Äù, there was only one approach, the text table (with income 
highlighted), that led to significantly improved outcomes across the board ‚Äì with improvements in comprehension, 
perceived clarity, decision-making ease, decision making confidence, and willingness to choose the CIPR. The greater 
effectiveness of text tables (versus graphs and number tables) was especially clear among women and younger 
(aged‚ÄØ45-54) individuals.
SUMMARY
BETA ‚Äî Supporting Retirees in Retirement Income Planning‚ÄÇ|‚ÄÇ 7
Members responded positively to the proposed new plan ‚Äì on average, members were around 50% willing to 
choose the CIPR if it were offered to them in the future. Given the lack of product diversity (94% of retirement 
assets in Australia are currently allocated to ABPs) and the fact that CIPRs are a new product, this level of interest is 
encouraging and suggests CIPRs may do well (in terms of customer take-up) in the market. 
Comprehension and willingness to choose the CIPR varied across segments. On average, males had slightly higher 
comprehension scores than females (3.63 vs. 3.51 out of 5 ‚Äì a 3.4% difference), and members who had consulted 
a financial planner had higher scores than those who had not (3.66 vs. 3.52 ‚Äì a 4.0% difference). Consistent with a 
bequest motive, members without children were more willing to choose the CIPR than were members with children 
(55.77% vs. 50.28%). Additionally, members who held an average or longer than average life expectancy also were 
more willing (51.43% and 53.03%, respectively) to choose the CIPR as compared to members who held a shorter 
than average life expectancy (47.72%).
Individuals generally made their choice about the CIPR in a way that aligned with their pre-stated preferences 
regarding what was most important for them. Members who prioritised income (‚ÄòI want to get the highest level of 
income in retirement, based on my superannuation balance‚Äô) or managing longevity risk (‚ÄòI want my superannuation 
to last my entire lifetime‚Äô), and deprioritised flexibility (‚ÄòI want to be able to access and use all of my superannuation 
when I want‚Ä¶‚Äô) were 18.9 to 28.83 percentage points (respectively) more likely to choose the CIPR than those who 
prioritised flexibility (expressing a contrasting preference profile). 
The findings of this survey are intended to contribute to the broader public consultation process that the 
Government is currently undertaking on the CIPRs framework2
. In particular, as our study specifically focussed 
on how to present information about CIPRs, the results might inform the regulatory framework governing how 
superannuation trustees may be required to present CIPRs to their members. We note however, that this study is 
just a first step in building an evidence base for this. As the CIPRs framework is being developed, there is opportunity 
to further test and fine-tune different approaches (informed by behavioural science) to support retirees in making 
well-informed decisions about how to best manage their retirement income",,"Financial, Superannuation",,,,,,,,,Supporting retirees ...~https://behaviouraleconomics.pmc.gov.au/projects/supporting-retirees-retirement-income-planning,,,,,,,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Regular RCT,3600,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

BETA & DSS,Encouraging survey participation to evaluate social service program outcomes,2017,"The Community Grants Hub, implemented by the Department of Social Services 
(DSS), supports the administration and delivery of over 21,000 community grants 
across government. These grants, worth around $7.8 billion, provide valuable 
support services to individuals, families and their communities across Australia. 
To enable the collection of meaningful data about service delivery outcomes from 
organisations receiving community grants, DSS introduced a new reporting platform 
called the Data Exchange. As part of this platform, DSS piloted a client survey to 
enable clients to self-report on why they sought assistance and the outcomes of 
accessing the service. We partnered with DSS to develop and test ways to 
encourage greater survey completion rates.
There are many reasons why people may not complete a survey in its entirety. 
People may not understand why the survey is important, may not anticipate how long 
it will take, or simply think the required effort is just not worth it.
To address these challenges, we incorporated small behaviourally-informed 
progress updates into the Data Exchange survey. Updates were presented in a form 
of a gradually completing pie-chart, accompanied by short messages with references 
to social norms and highlighting how completing the survey would benefit the 
individual and their community. 
We ran a trial to test whether our re-designed survey worked. We found our changes 
had a significant impact, increasing survey completion by 6.8 percentage points, 
from 84.7 per cent to 91.5 per cent.
The outcomes of this trial show how simple low-cost changes to survey design may 
increase survey completion. With many government and private organisations using 
surveys to better understand and service their clients, the significance of this finding 
extends beyond future redesigns of the Data Exchange survey and should be

BETA & Department of Energy,Electricity information to fit the bill: redesigning electricity bills to support consumer engagement,2018,"Part of the reason for this is the difficulty in comparing offers, with many consumers reporting 
they are not confident making choices in the electricity market. The ACCC‚Äôs recent Electricity 
supply and prices inquiry highlights there is unnecessary complexity in the way electricity 
plans are communicated. The Australian Energy Market Commission‚Äôs 2018 Retail Energy 
Competition Review similarly finds consumers have reached record-low levels of trust in the 
industry.
In our previous work, BETA found re-designing electricity price fact sheets could increase 
consumer confidence when it comes to engaging in the electricity market. But a range of 
behavioural traits still contribute to consumer inertia: the time and effort needed to seek out, 
compare offers and choose a plan can seem like it‚Äôs just not worth the hassle; and many 
consumers fear something will go wrong if they switch. 
Electricity bills are a key way to inform consumers about their plan and usage, but bills are 
typically confusing and not useful to help consumers navigate the electricity market. Given all 
electricity consumers receive bills, the bill itself presents a useful vehicle to communicate the 
information consumers need to engage confidently in the electricity market. 
In partnership with the Department of the Environment and Energy, we drew on behavioural 
insights to design and test six electricity bills. We focussed on simplifying bill design to draw 
attention to key information, and including a ‚Äòways to save‚Äô box encouraging consumers to 
search for and switch to a better plan.
We tested electricity bills with around 4,200 Australians through an online survey experiment 
focussing on two key outcomes:
ÔÇ∑ confidence using the electricity bill to help look into finding a better plan; and 
ÔÇ∑ stated intention to look into options for switching plans in the next year.
We found simplified bills with ‚Äòways to save‚Äô information increased consumers‚Äô confidence by 
up to 13 per cent. But this did not translate into intention to look for a better offer.
Increasing consumer confidence in a market facing record-low levels of trust is important. For 
this reason alone, making bills clearer and more accessible for consumers makes sense and 
should be considered by electricity retailers.",,"Energy, Financial ",,,,,,,,,Electricity information to fit the bill: redesigning electricity bills to support consumer engagement | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,,,,,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Online survey experiment,"4,200","The study found that simplified bills with 'ways to save' information increased consumers' confidence by up to 13 percent.

BETA & Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC),password123: Applying behavioural insights to cyber security advice,2019,"The risks of poor cyber security intensify as more aspects of people‚Äôs lives and businesses 
become digitised and connected online. The methods cybercriminals use are more 
sophisticated than ever, meaning regular (non-expert) individuals and small businesses must 
also improve their ability to detect scams and protect their personal and business accounts 
and devices.
To help improve the impact of cyber security advice for individuals and small businesses, 
BETA partnered with the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) to design and test 
different formats of advice. We conducted focus groups and two survey experiments (surveys 
with embedded randomised controlled trials) to understand whether behavioural insights 
concepts are effective in shifting people‚Äôs intentions to enact safer cyber security practices. 
We surveyed small and medium business (SMB) owners and operators and tested the effect 
of different formats of advice. 
We developed plain text advice, a visually engaging infographic, and an ‚Äòinteractive‚Äô format 
which asked a quiz question and then ‚Äòrevealed‚Äô the correct answer in an infographic. We 
found seeing any type of cyber security advice strengthened SMB‚Äôs intentions to update 
software and back up data, by nine per cent and six per cent respectively, compared to those 
who saw no advice. The interactive advice also appeared to improve SMB‚Äôs accuracy in 
identifying phishing (fake) emails from genuine ones. However, in most cases plain text 
advice performed just as well as the same content presented in an infographic or interactive 
format. This suggests simple, jargon-free language may still be the most important aspect to 
consider in any advice. 
To better understand which approaches resonate most with individuals, we conducted four 
focus groups across metropolitan and regional areas in New South Wales (two groups) and 
Victoria (two groups). We asked participants to tell us about their reactions to different design 
concepts, as well as talk to their level of cyber security expertise and their experience of
cyber incidents.
Based on these findings, we designed advice using the messenger effect and tested the 
impact of our designs in an online survey experiment. We compared a ‚Äòpeer‚Äô messenger to 
an ‚Äòexpert‚Äô messenger (two senior government officials working in cyber security). We also 
tested whether participants responded more strongly to advice emphasising financial or nonfinancial costs of having poor cyber security. 
We found some evidence messengers may have a small positive impact on people‚Äôs 
intentions to update their software, but we only have moderate confidence in this finding. We 
also found no effect from messengers on people‚Äôs intentions to use strong and different 
passwords across important accounts, and no effect on either cyber security practice from 
using different financial or non-financial loss framing. Overall, our research suggests making 
cyber security advice salient and engaging can help make key messages stand out. 
However, simply providing advice alone is insufficient to change behaviour, and further 
research is needed to better understand which formats, framing, and channels are most 
impactful for different groups",,Cyber security,,,,,,,,,password123: Applying behavioural insights to cyber security advice | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,,,,,Full study with results.,Survey experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The study showed some statistically significant results.

BETA & DSS,Applying behavioural insights to online wagering,2020,"Online wagering is the fastest growing segment of gambling in Australia, and people who 
gamble online have been found to experience higher rates of gambling-related harm 
compared with other forms of gambling (Jenkinson et al. 2019). The Department of Social 
Services (DSS) commissioned BETA to design and evaluate easy-to-understand activity 
statements for online wagering consumers. Activity statements provide online wagering 
consumers with details of their gambling activities, including bets made, wins, losses and 
other account transactions over a specified time period. Drawing on principles from the 
National Consumer Protection Framework for Online Wagering - National Policy Statement 
(National Framework) and insights from behavioural science, BETA developed and tested
two activity statement prototypes. 
In a behavioural trial (experiment) using a purpose-built simulated gambling platform, we 
found showing participants an activity statement reduced the amount they bet when 
compared with participants who did not see a statement (by 7.6 per cent for Statement A and 
4.9 per cent for Statement B). This suggests providing online gamblers with regular, clear and 
useful information about their gambling can strengthen informed decision-making.
We focussed the design and content of the activity statements on correcting several 
behavioural biases known to affect gambling decisions. These relate to misperceptions about 
the randomness of events and probabilities (expecting a win after a series of losses), 
misperceptions about personal attributes and behaviours (beliefs about being a lucky person) 
and loss aversion (valuing losses more than gains). We found activity statements had a 
stronger effect for participants who held false gambling beliefs.
We also found viewing activity statements to have a stronger effect on the amount bet for 
moderate-risk gamblers, and those with lower financial literacy. A significant effect was also 
found for gamblers with loss-chasing tendencies. Taken together these findings suggest the 
activity statements are effective for groups at-risk of harm from gambling.
Participants completed a survey at the end of the simulated gambling platform to examine 
their views on the usefulness and ease-of-understanding of the prototypes. Comprehension 
was high, and participants overwhelmingly indicated a desire to receive activity statements 
from their online wagering service provider. Nearly all participants (91 per cent) said they 
would like to receive the statements in real life; many preferred this to be via email and every 
month.
The results from this project suggest activity statements have a significant role to play in 
reducing harm from gambling and providing online wagering consumers with meaningful and 
accessible information in order to make informed decisions about their gambling. The report

BETA & ASIC,Slowing down to add it up: using behavioural insights to support decision-making about add-on insurance,2020,"Add-on insurance is insurance offered to consumers as an add-on when they buy a primary 
product (the main item consumers buy). Examples include travel insurance when buying a flight 
and extended warranties on items like phones, laptops, or whitegoods. Numerous reviews have 
found consumers often receive poor value for money, experience pressure to buy, and have 
low levels of understanding of and engagement with the add-on insurance market (Australian 
Securities and Investments Commission [ASIC], 2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2019; Productivity 
Commission, 2018; Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and 
Financial Services Industry, 2019; Treasury, 2019).
A number of behavioural biases and heuristics come into play when people consider insurance
generally, including loss, risk, and regret aversion. By tacking an offer onto the end of the 
primary purchase, the sales environment for add-on insurance heightens these and other
barriers such as sunk cost bias and anchoring to the price of the main product. These are 
further exacerbated during in-person sales, where the rapport a sales person builds during the 
consumer‚Äôs purchase of the primary product may make it harder for the consumer to say ‚Äòno‚Äô.
The Government has agreed to address these concerns through a deferred sales model, with 
ASIC to be given power to mandate the content of an information statement at the start of the 
deferral period. BETA partnered with ASIC to design and test an information statement to 
address some of these barriers and help consumers make more informed decisions by 
intervening in the sales process and providing an opt-out mechanism. In particular, the 
intervention sought to highlight the fact add-on insurance is not compulsory, prompt consumers 
to consider the value of the insurance and their personal circumstances, and encourage them 
to shop around. We also tested devices such as colour, icons, the government crest, and an 
Australian dollar coin to engage people in the content of the statement. We tested the effect of 
seeing an information statement, as well as variations of different statement designs, using a 
framed field experiment with a nationally representative sample of 6,243 people.
We found being given any information statement substantially decreased sales of add-on 
insurance in our experiment. Of people who were given an information statement, 29 per cent 
bought add-on insurance compared to 38 per cent of people who were not given an information 
statement. This is a 24 per cent reduction: a large and statistically significant difference. The 
impact was similar across all statement designs.
Our findings support the use of timely, clear, targeted and engaging prompts to better inform
consumers and help slow down the decision-making process. They also suggest the 
information statement gave people ‚Äòpermission‚Äô to turn down the offer by reminding them they 
weren‚Äôt legally required to buy add-on insurance. Looking ahead, research in real-world 
settings can help determine the long term impact of an information statement on demand for 
add-on insurance in Australia. Regardless of the final design, an information statement can act 
as an effective intervention to help create a buffer between the main sale and add-on sale, 
giving consumers space to make a decision",,Financial,,,,,,,,,https://behaviouraleconomics.pmc.gov.au/projects/slowing-down-add-it-using-behavioural-insights-support-decision-making-about-add-insurance,,,,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Framed field experiment,6243,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

BETA & Australian Financial Security Authority,Clearer consequences: Helping people understand the outcomes of bankruptcy,2020,"For people in financial difficulties, applying for bankruptcy is a major life decision. Bankruptcy
releases people from most types of debt, giving them a fresh start. There are, however, 
additional consequences to applying for bankruptcy ‚Äì and deciding whether the benefits 
outweigh these consequences can be challenging. 
Applicants may experience cognitive overload due to new, complex and unfamiliar 
information ‚Äì making it harder to make the optimal decision. Some applicants may be overly 
optimistic in their ability to deal with bankruptcy consequences and fail to consider them in 
full, or they may simply not wish to engage with distressing information. 
The Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA) oversees personal insolvencies (including 
bankruptcy) in Australia. In 2020, AFSA streamlined the bankruptcy application process by 
moving it online, and worked to ensure applicants understand the consequences of going 
bankrupt before they apply.
BETA and AFSA worked together to develop several approaches to informing people about 
the consequences of bankruptcy, giving them the required information to make an 
appropriate decision for their circumstances. We ran two evaluation projects: 
1. Increasing understanding of the consequences of bankruptcy
Most bankruptcy applicants need to complete an educational tool (known as the 
‚Äòconsequences tool‚Äô) before they can apply for bankruptcy. In an online experiment with the 
general public, we tested six versions of the consequences tool. We measured people‚Äôs 
understanding of the consequences of bankruptcy by asking them a set of questions after 
they had completed one of the consequences tools.
People who did not see any consequences tool had a relatively low understanding of 
bankruptcy. They were able to correctly identify fewer than half of the consequences. The 
current consequences tool and the ‚ÄòPrescribed Information‚Äô (information presented to all 
applicants at the start of the bankruptcy application form) improved people‚Äôs understanding of 
the consequences. Two further educational tools, a video and a pop-up quiz, performed the 
best in improving people‚Äôs understanding and confidence.
2. Testing the impact of tailored and timely prompts within the application form
In a randomised controlled trial with bankruptcy applicants, we evaluated the effect of five 
prompts within the online bankruptcy application form. These prompts provided timely and 
tailored information on the consequences of bankruptcy. For the most part, including the 
prompts did not influence applicants‚Äô reporting behaviour (completion rate, value and count of 
assets, income declared), and did not have any unintended side-effects. 
The findings of these projects have broader implications for how the Government 
communicates with citizens. Across many services, the Government often needs to ensure 
people understand and apply complex information. This research contributes to our 
understanding of how this is best achieved",,Financial,,,,,,,,,Clearer consequences: Helping people understand the outcomes of bankruptcy | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,"The study showed that the video and pop-up quiz educational tools performed the best in improving people's understanding and confidence regarding the consequences of bankruptcy.

BETA & Australian Financial Security Authority,Introducing behavioural insights to the Personal Property Securities Register,2020,"The Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR) supports the growth of Australia‚Äôs economy. The 
PPSR makes it easy for businesses to safeguard their security interests (money owed to them or other 
obligations), helps them make informed purchasing decisions, and facilitates secured lending.
Businesses (and other entity types) register on the PPSR by completing an online form hosted by the 
Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA).
For a registration to be effective, businesses must provide details about themselves, the assets they 
are registering, and the other party in the transaction (known as the Grantor). Our previous research 
indicates some less frequent PPSR users get some of these details incorrect - in particular, details 
relating to the other party.
In response to BETA‚Äôs recommendations from our previous research (BETA 2020), AFSA 
implemented enhancements to the PPSR system, processes and supporting information. These 
enhancements focused on improving the experience for infrequent users. Two of these 
recommendations were evaluated using randomised controlled trials (RCTs):
1. A redesigned review screen
To prevent users from rushing through the registration process and to highlight the importance 
of registering correctly, we redesigned the review screen. A new pop-up alerted users that 
incorrectly completed registrations may not be valid. Users were also required to confirm 
details about themselves, details of what they were registering and details of the Grantor. We 
found these new additions to the review screen did not result in any improvement in the 
accuracy of registrations. 
2. New layout of the Grantor page and error-warning prompts
We introduced a more intuitive way of asking users to identify the Grantor. We also added five 
customised prompts that appeared when a mistake relating to a Grantor was made. These 
changes almost halved the number of incorrect transactions: 22.3% of PPSR transactions 
made by users who completed the business-as-usual registration form were incorrect, 
compared to only 12.8% of transactions made by those who saw the redesigned page. 
These evaluations shed light on ways government agencies can help less frequent users navigate 
complex registration processes. AFSA is planning to adopt the prompts as its business-as-usual 
practice, and is considering how to adopt the new Grantor page layout across the different user 
cohorts. Given the review screen did not decrease incorrect transactions, AFSA have opted to 
maintain their current review screen",,Financial,,,,,,,,,Introducing behavioural insights to the Personal Property Securities Register | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

BETA & Home Affairs,Stay smart: helping consumers choose cyber secure smart devices,2021,"Smart‚Äô devices are products with extra functionality to connect to the internet. Many smart 
devices lack basic cyber security features, and their rising popularity increases the risk of 
cyber security incidents and cybercrime. Consumers may not be aware of the risk of insecure 
smart devices, as it is currently difficult to find and use cyber security information when 
shopping for smart devices. As a result, manufacturers are not sufficiently incentivised to 
invest in cyber security.
A cyber security labelling scheme may help consumers make better purchasing
decisions. A label could communicate to consumers the overall level of cyber security of the 
device, or specific details such as for how long it will continue to receive security updates. 
This would allow consumers to compare products and make more cyber secure purchases.
In partnership with the Department of Home Affairs, BETA explored how cyber security labels 
could perform in an Australian setting. We designed three different cyber security labels:
a ‚Äògraded‚Äô label, using shield and tick icons to indicate four levels of cyber security; and two 
‚Äòexpiry‚Äô labels, indicating how long the device would receive guaranteed security updates 
(e.g. ‚Äúguaranteed until August 2023‚Äù). One expiry label included an icon, the other simply 
included the same information in plain text. 
We tested the labels in an online ‚Äòshopping scenario‚Äô with a nationally representative sample 
of 6,000 Australians. Participants were asked to choose which smart devices they would like 
to ‚Äòbuy‚Äô. We found:
‚Ä¢ Participants were more likely to choose a device with a cyber security label than one 
without a label, by 13-19 percentage points.
‚Ä¢ The graded shield had the largest impact, but the expiry labels were still effective.
‚Ä¢ A high security level or long expiry date increased the likelihood of choosing a device.
Follow-up questions and analysis allowed us to examine the different advantages and 
disadvantages of each label:
‚Ä¢ Participants preferred both the graded shield label and the icon expiry label over the 
plain text expiry label.
‚Ä¢ Participants generally had a better understanding of what the two expiry labels were 
communicating compared to the graded shield label. 
We expect in the real world people‚Äôs understanding of the labels would increase over time as 
they become familiar with them, and especially if supported by a consumer education 
campaign.
These results demonstrate the potential for a labelling scheme to improve consumer 
decision-making in the Australian smart device market. Further research in the field ‚Äì
such as partnering with a retailer and evaluating the impact of cyber security labels on real 
choices made by actual consumers ‚Äì could be considered to test how the current findings

BETA & Organ and Tissue Authority,Improving organ donor registration among young adults,2021,"The Organ and Tissue Authority (OTA) engaged the Behavioural Economics Team of the 
Australian Government (BETA) to learn more about how young adults (18-25 years) view 
organ donation, and to inform their annual DonateLife Week community awareness 
campaign. In particular, the OTA noted the large gap between the proportion of young adults 
who say they want to be organ donors and the proportion who have actually registered on the 
Australian Organ Donor Register. The act of registering is important as it provides a clear 
indication of wishes to family, and results in an increased likelihood that if a family is 
approached to consent to donation in the hospital, they will agree. In turn, this can help more 
people get a life-saving organ transplant.
The project involved 3 stages.
‚Ä¢ We conducted desktop research of organ donation and behavioural science 
literatures and developed draft messages for potential use by the OTA.
‚Ä¢ In May 2021, we ran four focus groups with 5-7 young adults per group, to learn 
about their views on organ donation, and to gather feedback on the draft messages.
‚Ä¢ Also in May, we conducted an online survey experiment and survey with 1,382 
respondents to gather views from a larger sample and to better understand which 
messages influence behaviour.
Many young adults want to be organ donors but just haven‚Äôt gotten around to it. That is, 
there is an intention-action gap when it comes to registering as an organ donor. One 
explanation for this is that young adults typically overestimate how difficult it will be to register
as an organ donor. (It is actually pretty easy.)
We used an online survey experiment to test 3 messages to assess whether they boosted 
registration intentions, as well as click throughs to the registration webpage and actual 
registrations. The most effective message highlighted how easy it is to register. It 
boosted intentions to register within the next week by 7-8 percentage points compared to the 
alternatives messages (29% of respondents versus 21-22%). However, in a separate survey 
question, respondents preferred other messages. Nonetheless, we consider the experimental 
evidence on intentions to register as stronger evidence than stated preferences. 
People are more likely to register if there are more opportunities to do so. Young adults 
would welcome opportunities to register as part of other government processes. Ideally, such 
processes would be in some way related to organ donation. Utilising Medicare interactions 
presents a compelling option (with 72% of respondents responding positively). Other popular 
options included the myGov platform (55%), and driver‚Äôs licences (54%).

BETA & Treasury,YourSuper Comparison Tool: Results from a survey and two survey experiments,2021,"Why we undertook this project
Many Australians have invested their savings in superannuation funds that significantly underperform benchmark net returns. This is typically due to a combination of weak returns and high fees. Ultimately, underperformance can lead to retirement savings that are far lower than they might have been. 
The YourSuper Comparison Tool website (‚Äòthe comparison tool‚Äô) was developed to empower superannuation fund members. The comparison tool allows people to compare the performance and fees of MySuper products, with the aim of making it easier for them to choose a well performing product that meets their needs.  
What we did
The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) led the design and development of the comparison tool, in collaboration with a multi-agency team comprising staff from the Treasury, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), and the Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government (BETA). 
BETA and the ATO‚Äôs Behavioural Insights Unit worked together to contribute behavioural insights to the design process. This included running a survey and 2 survey experiments to generate relevant evidence. The survey, completed by 2,236 eligible respondents in January 2021, included questions on: when respondents would be likely to use the comparison tool, the best way to describe a poor performer, and, in which format they would prefer an ‚Äòunderperformance notice‚Äô (mail or email). 
Results and limitations
In the first survey experiment, we tested how super products were classified and sorted on the results page of the comparison tool. They were either placed into 2 categories (‚Äòpoor‚Äô or ‚Äògood‚Äô performance) or 3 categories (‚Äòpoor‚Äô, ‚Äòfair‚Äô, or ‚Äòtop‚Äô performance). As we expected, respondents who saw the additional ‚Äòtop‚Äô performance category were better at selecting one of the best performing funds than those who saw only 2 performance categories.  
In the second experiment, we tested different ways to communicate the risk/return trade off associated with different super products. For example we tested accurate but technical language (such as ‚Äòlow risk and low expected return‚Äô) against terms that are common in the super industry but where the risk level is implied (such as ‚Äòconservative‚Äô, ‚Äòbalanced‚Äô and ‚Äògrowth‚Äô). Respondents who were presented with common industry terms for risk/return were better at selecting the optimal option in the scenario presented.
Our overall judgement is that these results are likely to reflect how people would respond to these design options in the real world. Some caution is warranted since survey experiments only test responses in an artificial setting. Furthermore, online survey panels are not fully representative of the general population. However, we collected a large and diverse sample of superannuation members, and we designed an experiment that sought to mimic real world decision making. 
This research was considered in the development of the YourSuper comparison tool alongside user research conducted by the ATO and consultation with the super fund industry and other stakeholders.

BETA & ACCC,Increasing transparency of online foreign exchange calculators,2023,"Every year, Australians transfer an estimated $21 billion to family and friends overseas, 
making use of international money transfer (IMT) services (ACCC 2019). However, IMT 
pricing is complex and often not transparent for consumers. To assist businesses supplying 
IMT services, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission issued best practice 
guidance, aimed at improving how IMT offers are presented to consumers. As a result, 
businesses now provide IMT calculators to allow consumers to better understand the 
costs associated with the transaction, and ultimately get better value for their transfer.
However, while IMT calculators can help, there is still room for improvement. Calculators 
differ from provider to provider, which means that comparing offers across different 
calculators is challenging. In particular, when a calculator adds fees (rather than subtracting 
them) it is harder to compare offers; no-fee transfers can ‚Äòhide‚Äô the cost of the transaction in a 
high foreign exchange rate (FX) margin; and the total cost of the transaction to the customer 
is often hard to determine directly. 
BETA worked with the ACCC to design and test changes to online IMT calculators that 
could help consumers choose better value offers. We first designed seven new 
calculators to address the three key problems outlined above. We then ran online survey 
experiments with 5,673 Australians to test which type of calculator best helped consumers 
choose the best value offer. We found: 
Consistently subtracting fees made it easy to compare offers and choose the best 
deal. When fees are consistently subtracted, the cost to the customer remains the same 
across providers and people can therefore rely on the amount received by the recipient ‚Äì a 
common heuristic ‚Äì to accurately guide them to the highest value offer. Consistently 
subtracting fees also made people more confident in their choices.
Providing ‚Äòcomparison rate prompts‚Äô also improved people‚Äôs ability to choose the best 
deal. These prompts summarised the total cost of the transaction as a dollar value or per 
cent. Further, the prompts were also the most impactful when people were asked to judge the 
value from a single calculator (without a comparison). We found no evidence of ‚Äòcognitive 
overload‚Äô or other downsides when combining elements in a single calculator; e.g. adding 
prompts, FX margins, and consistently subtracting fees.
Based on these findings, subtracting fees and adding a comparison prompt would result in 
the highest performance both when consumers are considering a single offer, and when they 
are comparing offers. These results demonstrate the potential for improvements to IMT 
calculators further helping consumers choose the best deal when making international 
money transfers. Further research in the field ‚Äì such as partnering with an IMT provider and 
evaluating the impact of calculators on real choices made by actual consumers ‚Äì could be 
considered to test how the current findings translate to a real-world context",,"Financial, Currency exchange",,,,,,,,,Increasing transparency of online foreign exchange calculators | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,,,,,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Regular RCT,5673,The study found that consistently subtracting fees and providing comparison rate prompts improved consumers' ability to choose the best value offer.

BETA & APSC,Increasing disability identification in the Australian Public Service,2023,"All government agencies collect employee data, including disability status, in human resource 
(HR) information systems for the Australian Public Service Employment Database (APSED). 
At June 2023, half as many people have shared they have a disability in HR systems 
(5.1%) compared to those who have shared the same information in the de-identified 
Australian Public Service Employee Census (10.9%; APSC 2023a).
Attitudinal, organisational and structural barriers prevent some employees from sharing their 
information in HR systems. Workplace culture, policies and practices influence employee 
comfort in sharing information. Moreover, some staff choose not to share information 
because they do not see a benefit to doing so or hold concerns about negative career 
impacts. Explaining the purpose of sharing information and the protections in place can help 
reduce ambiguity and overcome these barriers. Our research focuses on how agencies 
communicate about disability data collection and use. 
Across 2 projects, we applied behavioural science to help inform APS employees about 
disability data collection:

BETA & Department of Energy,Energy labels that make cents: A randomised controlled trial to test the effect of appliance energy rating labels,2017,"In 2015, Australian households contributed 11.1 per cent of Australia‚Äôs carbon 
emissions (Commonwealth of Australia, 2017), with about 45 per cent of these 
carbon emissions accounted for by household appliances and equipment (Reidy and 
Milne, 2017). Lower efficiency appliances contribute greater emissions and cost 
consumers more to run. 
To encourage production of more energy efficient appliances and assist consumers 
to make more informed choices, the Australian Government requires an Energy 
Rating Label on appliances sold in stores. This requirement does not extend to 
appliances sold online. 
Energy labels can provide important information on energy consumption and running 
costs, which consumers may otherwise be unaware of when making decisions about 
which appliances to buy. Absence of this information could lead them to undervalue 
more efficient appliances. Higher energy efficient appliances often cost more 
up-front, but over time can lower household energy bills and reduce overall 
emissions. The Energy Rating Label aims to help consumers compare the energy 
efficiency of similar appliances by providing information on average annual energy 
use in kilowatt-hours (kWh) and assigning a star rating to each appliance. 
In partnership with the Department of the Environment and Energy (DoEE) and 
Appliances Online we conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the 
impact of energy labels on decisions made by Australian consumers shopping for 
appliances in an online environment. We assessed the impact of the Energy Rating 
Label and we used behavioural insights to design and test an alternative label. 
Growing evidence from behavioural economics shows most people have difficulty 
making decisions when they have to weigh immediate costs against future benefits 
accruing slowly over time, and comparing multiple options with multiple attributes. To 
address this, we designed a simple, more salient label to inform consumers of how 
much money they could avoid losing by buying a more efficient appliance compared 
to the lowest rated, one-star appliance of the same size and capacity. 
Information on the alternative label was expressed in simple dollar terms rather than 
the more abstract kWh metric. We expected this form of labelling would make 
consumers more aware of hip-pocket costs ‚Äì for example, a person buying a 
four-star top mount fridge could avoid losing $1,700 in lifetime running costs 
compared to a one-star top mount fridge.",,Energy and environment,,,,,,,,,Energy labels that m...~https://behaviouraleconomics.pmc.gov.au/projects/energy-labels-make-cents-randomised-controlled-trial-test-effect-appliance-energy-rating,,,Original database,Mar-18,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,The description does not provide specific information on whether the study showed statistically significant results or what the results were.,Environment / energy; Business

BETA & ATO,Making it less taxing - better compliance with deferred GST,2017,"The Australian Taxation Office is the Australian Government‚Äôs principal revenue 
collection agency and administers Australia‚Äôs tax system and significant aspects of 
Australia‚Äôs superannuation system. It administers legislation governing tax, 
superannuation and the Australian Business Register and supports the delivery of 
government benefits to the community. Improving tax compliance is a major policy 
goal as non-compliance can reduce the overall tax base, increase the costs of 
administration and lead to an uneven playing field for businesses doing the right 
thing. 
As part of the legislation the Deferred Goods and Services Tax (DGST) Scheme 
allows businesses to defer the payment of GST on taxable importations into 
Australia. This helps businesses manage their cash flow. Cash flow is important for 
businesses because it helps them meet everyday business needs and avoid taking 
on more debt. This means there is a strong driver for businesses to be on the 
Scheme. Participation in the Scheme allows 13,000 businesses to defer payment of 
$26 billion in GST annually.
To be on the Scheme, businesses must comply with requirements including digital 
lodgment of monthly activity statements and being up to date on all lodgments and 
payments due to the ATO. At any one time about one in three businesses do not 
comply. The ATO can revoke access to the Scheme if a business does not fully 
comply, which negatively affects cash flow and means the business will need to 
reapply to be reinstated. 
BETA partnered with the ATO to test behaviourally informed methods of 
communication (variations on emails) aimed at improving compliance among 
businesses in the Scheme. We ran two separate randomised controlled trials to test 
the effectiveness of these emails. 
The first trial evaluated the impact of sending a ‚Äòcooperative‚Äô or ‚Äòdirect‚Äô toned 
reminder email to existing businesses who were found to be non-compliant with the 
Scheme. The aim was to encourage self-compliance, educate businesses on their
tax obligations and reduce recurrent non-compliance. Both emails improved 
compliance rates but variations in the tone of the reminders did not affect the 
compliance rate.

The second trial tested the effectiveness of sending a welcome email to new 
businesses who had just registered on the Scheme. The aim of the email was to 
educate the businesses from the first point of contact to promote good compliance 
behaviours and engagement with the ATO. The email contained a planning prompt

BETA & ATO,Improving tax compliance: deductions for work related expenses in income tax returns filed through tax agents,2017,"In the Australian Income Tax system, individual taxpayers are entitled to claim deductions for expenses 
incurred while earning salary and wage income. These deductions are called work related expenses. 
According to Taxation Statistics, work related expense deductions grew by 15 per cent from 2010-11 to 
2015 16. In 2015-16, 8.6 million taxpayers claimed nearly $22 billion in work related expense deductions. 
There is evidence that claims for work-related expense deductions can be erroneous and there is a 
propensity to over claim, including in returns prepared by tax agents. In his National Press Club address on 
5 July 2017, the Commissioner of Taxation expressed concern about the accuracy of work-related expense 
claims related to work, clothing and vehicles in the 2014-15 financial year. While individual amounts overclaimed can be small, the sum and overall revenue impact is significant. The Commissioner estimated the 
overall revenue impact was in the vicinity of $2.5 billion. 
Research by H&R Block in 2016 indicated one in five taxpayers believed misrepresentation of tax return 
information isn‚Äôt so bad, and 71 per cent believed they could claim something they were not entitled to 
(Lonergan Research 2016). PhD research (Wurth 2013) found tax agents rated their clients‚Äô work-related 
expense claims as the ‚Äòleast compliant‚Äô label on the tax return. Behavioural insights offers a low-cost tool to 
address these behaviours and underlying attitudes and help taxpayers willingly comply with the tax system. 
The Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government (BETA) partnered with the Australian 
Taxation Office (ATO) to examine the extent to which behaviourally-informed communications to tax agents 
could reduce erroneous work related expense claims. In particular, we tested the effectiveness of a letter 
sent to tax agents drawing on behavioural insights to address social norms.
We used a randomised controlled trial to test the impact of sending this letter to tax agents whose clients 
had higher than expected work-related expense claims compared to their peers. The letter specifically 
identified each agent‚Äôs clients who had lodged higher than expected claims (referred to as ‚Äòidentified 
clients‚Äô). There were over 2,000 tax agents in the trial, who were randomly assigned to a letter group or a 
‚Äòno letter‚Äô control group.
17 per cent of agents in the letter group lodged amendments, compared with 1 per cent of agents in the ‚Äòno 
letter‚Äô group. On average, identified clients represented by agents in the letter group reduced their work 
related expense claims by $191, compared with a $2 increase in the ‚Äòno letter‚Äô group. Overall, identified 
clients reduced their work-related expense claims by a total of $2.2 million. If we had sent the letter to all 
agents in the trial, including those who did not receive a letter, we expect this simple messaging 
intervention would have decreased work related expense deductions by about $4.4 million.
The letter led to an increase in the average total tax paid per client of $76, for a total of $0.9 million. If we 
had sent the letter to all agents in the trial, total tax revenue would have increased by an estimated $1.7 
million. We cannot be sure about the contribution of the reduction in work-related expense claims to the 
increase in tax paid, because amendments to tax return labels other than work-related expenses could 
have influenced the net tax position. 
Overall, these findings indicate low-cost, well-targeted and well-designed communications incorporating 
behavioural insights are effective in reducing erroneous work-related expense claims although the length of 
time for which this behavioural change is sustained remains unknown",,Tax,,,,,,,,,Improving tax compliance: deductions for work related expenses in income tax returns filed through tax agents | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,Original database,Aug-18,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,"Over 2,000 tax agents.",The study showed statistically significant results.

"BETA, Treasury & Westpac",Credit when it's due: Reducing credit card debt,2017,"People who make only the minimum repayment on their credit 
card could be paying hundreds of dollars a year in high 
interest payments. SMS reminders are an effective tool to 
encourage people to repay more and save money.
Credit cards give people flexibility, allowing them to make short-term payments they may 
otherwise have to forgo or delay. Repaying the balance as soon as possible means avoiding 
high interest charges. Despite such a strong financial incentive, many people consistently 
repay only the minimum amount‚Äîcosting them potentially hundreds of dollars more a year. 
While many people often simply cannot afford to pay more than the minimum, evidence 
suggests many others repay only the minimum due to one or more behavioural biases such 
as status quo bias, present bias, optimism bias, or anchoring. To help, we designed a 
behaviourally informed intervention to see whether we could encourage consumers to pay 
earlier and save money. 
To test this, we worked with Westpac and the Treasury to design reminder messages, 
encouraging consumers who consistently pay only the minimum, to repay more. We 
incorporated words and phrases designed to make the benefits of repaying credit card 
balances as soon as possible more salient. We then evaluated the effect of these messages 
using a randomised controlled trial.
SMS reminders had an immediate impact on consumer repayment behaviour, resulting in a 
$134 (28 per cent) increase in repayments and close to a one percentage point increase in 
balance paid in the following month, compared to consumers who received no message. We 
also found a long-term effect on the balance owed. Consumers who received an SMS 
reminder had, on average, smaller balances twelve months later. By contrast, there was no 
such effect from sending email reminders.
The specific content or wording used in the SMS did not seem to matter. Consumers who 
received any type of SMS reminder increased repayments. Repetition also appeared to have 
little impact. Sending reminders again in subsequent months did not have the same impact 
as the initial message.
Our research suggests sending an SMS reminder to consumers before their payment due 
date can encourage them to make higher repayments. Further research into the message 
content, timing, and frequency is warranted. In any case, SMS reminders are a simple, costeffective tool to support consumer decision-making and improve financial wellbeing in the

BETA & Fair Work Ombudsman,Building Persistent Compliance with Labour Law: Evidence from a Randomised Controlled Trial,2017,"All employees working in Australia are entitled to a minimum wage and 
standards of employment. The underpayment of wages and 
entitlements is a serious social and economic issue affecting workers, 
businesses and the community.
Drawing on BETA‚Äôs insights from behavioural science and the Fair Work Ombudsman‚Äôs (FWO) experience, 
we partnered to test the impact of audits on around 2,000 small businesses, and to see if small changes to 
the audit processes could lead to better outcomes for workers, businesses and the community.
Small business owners can feel overwhelmed by competing priorities. Our aim in redesigning audit 
processes was to support employers to understand and meet their obligations. To help improve compliance 
further, we simplified communications, drawing on behaviourally informed techniques such as planning 
prompts, and added a reminder of the annual wage increase. We tested whether this would lead to higher 
levels of ongoing compliance a year after the audit was undertaken.
We found the FWO‚Äôs standard audits improve ongoing rates of compliance with award wage rates. 
Furthermore, the behaviourally informed changes we made to the audit communications and process 
(including timely reminders) reduced non-compliance with monetary entitlements by a further 24 per cent
(14.6 per cent compared with 19.3 per cent for the standard audit). We estimate this led to employees 
being $900 per person better off annually, as compared to the standard audit. This was driven by 
improvements in ongoing compliance. In total, the three audit variations helped prevent underpayments for 
around 200 employees, representing a drop of about 30 per cent in the number of underpaid employees. 
In addition, we found businesses rated the 
behaviourally informed audit significantly more helpful 
and informative; as well as less confronting, complex, 
and confusing. The audits were also faster for 
employers to complete and to supply records, 
taking 15 days compared with 23 days for the 
standard audit.
These small changes are cost-effective and 
easily scalable, both across the FWO‚Äôs audits 
and other services and resources delivered by 
the FWO. Insights gained from this trial are 
useful for the FWO and other organisations 
when designing other communications and 
compliance-related services. These 
improvements are a win-win for workers,

BETA & Australian Cyber Security Centre,On the alert: Using behavioural insights to boost the impact of cyber security alerts,2020,"We partnered with the Australian Signals Directorate‚Äôs (ASD) Australian Cyber Security 
Centre (ACSC) to find ways of boosting the impact of an email alert system. The ACSC alert 
service alert system (the ‚Äòalert service‚Äô) is a free email subscription service available to the 
public. An alert is sent to subscribers whenever an emerging cyber security trend or threat 
becomes apparent. The alerts outline what people should look for, how to avoid or prevent 
the incident from happening to them, and what to do if someone may have been impacted. 
The alert service has been running since 2010 and had over 57,000 subscribers as of August 
2020.
Despite the large reach of the alert system, email can be a difficult platform to spread 
awareness compared with other, more visible channels such as SMS or social media. We 
applied behavioural insights to the email design to bolster its effects, and tested these
different design aspects using a randomised controlled trial. Our email trial was launched in 
February 2020, and used the top performing alerts of 2019 as the basis for the alert content. 
Subscribers were randomly assigned to receive an alert with one or more of our new design 
features (or a business-as-usual alert with the standard branding). Everyone received the 
same email content.
We trialled two new behaviourally informed design features: salient icons at the top of the 
page designed to give readers information about the urgency or action required at a glance, 
and a banner calling upon users to share the alert with their contacts.
We found including icons increased email open rates and interaction with the alert, and 
encouraging subscribers to share the alert with others increased forwarding rates. Without 
the icons, 2.9 per cent of subscribers interacted with the email by clicking on embedded links. 
This increased to 3.6 per cent for the best performing icon. Of those whose email did not 
include a sharing banner, 0.3 per cent shared the email by forwarding it or through social 
media. This more than doubled to 0.8 per cent of those whose email did include a banner. 
Small improvements to emails can make a big difference when applied to the alert service 
database with over 57,000 subscribers. For example, adding an action icon to a business-asusual alert could result in over 940 more readers opening the email. Including a sharing 
banner could result in around 320 more people sharing each alert with friends, family, and 
colleagues. Including a timing icon could result in an extra 360 people saving or printing a
copy of the alert. Icons and banners are low-cost, low-effort ways to improve the spread and 
appeal of emails with important information for the public",,Cyber security,,,,,,,,,On the alert: Using ...~https://behaviouraleconomics.pmc.gov.au/projects/alert-using-behavioural-insights-boost-impact-cyber-security-alerts,,,Original database,Jan-21,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,"57,000","The study showed statistically significant results.

"BETA, DSS & PMC",Increasing workplace giving,2018,"Behaviourally informed emails from a senior manager and 
easier sign-up can increase charitable workplace giving. 
Planned giving, including workplace giving through payroll, is important to charities and 
not-for-profit organisations as it provides a regular source of income. Although more 
Australian employers are offering workplace giving, employee participation is usually low. 
On behalf of the Prime Minister‚Äôs Community Business Partnership and in collaboration with 
the Department of Social Services (DSS), BETA tested ways to increase workplace giving 
across three separate behavioural trials, in two Australian Public Service (APS) departments
and with one corporate partner. The trials were conducted between 2018 ‚Äì 2021. 
For trial one, we applied behavioural insights to the design of an email from a senior manager 
in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) and tested the impact through a 
randomised controlled trial (RCT). At another PM&C site, we conducted a before/after 
comparison of the email in combination with a small gift. We found the behaviourally informed 
email increased workplace giving participation from 2.0% to 3.3%. Behaviourally informed 
emails outperformed basic information emails. The gift in combination with the email 
increased workplace giving but was not more effective than the behaviourally informed email 
alone.
For trial two, we built on these results in DSS. We tested variations of the behaviourally 
informed email with two different messengers (emails from a senior manager and a peer 
messenger), alongside an easier sign-up process. The best-performing intervention came 
from a senior manager, combined with the simpler sign-up process. This resulted in a 
workplace giving rate of 3.8%, compared with 1.4% for an email from a peer messenger 
using the existing sign-up process. 
For trial three, we tested a behaviourally informed email in a corporate setting using an RCT. 
We tested whether asking people to ‚Äògive later‚Äô, with a time delay between committing to give 
and monetary donations, would result in higher workplace giving sign-ups than asking people 
to ‚Äògive now‚Äô. The overall sign-up rate was very low, possibly due to environmental factors
relating to COVID-19. No significant differences were found between the two groups. 
Our studies in two APS departments show sending employees emails with information about 
their workplace giving program can increase participation. Behaviourally informed emails
from a senior manager can have an even bigger impact. Testing in different organisational 
settings is important as we found the behaviourally informed emails did not increase 
workplace giving sign-ups in a corporate environment. Making the sign-up process as easy 
as possible is important and alternative mediums to email should be considered if email 
communication is already heavily relied upon in the workplace. Applying these small, low-cost 
changes can increase charitable workplace giving.",,Philanthropy,,,,,,,,,Increasing workplace...~https://behaviouraleconomics.pmc.gov.au/projects/increasing-workplace-giving,,,Original database,Mar-22,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

BETA & DSS,Workplace giving at corporate partner,2022,"Planned giving is an important source of income for the 
not-for-profit sector. While more employers are offering 
workplace giving programs, participation is low.
Planned giving is important for the not for profit sector as it can provide them with a reliable 
source of income, helping them plan their activities. Planned giving is also financially 
beneficial for charities, reducing processing costs by receiving lump sum payments, providing 
access to new donors and decreasing the need for expensive fundraisers.
Research on giving trends in Australia found respondents who planned their donations 
reported giving six times more than those who identified as spontaneous givers (McGregorLowndes et al, 2017). Planned giving can include once-off donations like bequests, and 
regular payments such as workplace giving.
Workplace giving allows employees to donate some of their pre-tax salary to charity directly 
through payroll at work. The employee can benefit from an immediate tax deduction without 
the need to keep receipts and the convenience of automatic donations. 
In recent years, workplace giving represented around one per cent of total gifts or donations 
(ATO, 2019a). The amount donated through workplace giving in Australia increased from 
$23 million in 2009-10 to $43 million in 2018-19 (Workplace Giving Australia, 2020). 
The total number of employers in Australia offering workplace giving programs has increased 
from 2,809 in 2009-10 to 5,382 in 2018-19, with 33% of working Australians having access
(Workplace Giving Australia, 2020). But the proportion of employees enrolled in these 
programs remained at around 5% over this period, leaving room for improvement (Workplace 
Giving Australia, 2020). If 10% of working Australians donated $5 a week through workplace 
giving, an additional $338 million would be available to the community each year1. 
Different organisational factors, such as governance structures, salary and perceptions of
corporate social responsibility can impact giving behaviour (Shaker & Christensen, 2019). 
Workplace giving is known to vary significantly by industry (Osili et al. 2011) and organisation 
size (Haski-Leventhal, 2013). 
Past research has found employees of for-profit organisations gave at higher rates than the 
public sector (Witty & Urla, 1989; Haski-Leventhal, 2013). Of the private sector organisations 
in Australia offering workplace giving, the most up-to-date publically available data shows 
5.9% of employees participate (ATO, 2016). Of the APS agencies offering workplace giving, 
1.8% of employees participate, each donating on average around $375 per annum over the 
year in 2017-18 (ATO, 2019b).",,Philanthropy,,,,,,,,,,,,Original database,Mar-22,,,This is a full study with results.,Something else,Unsure,The sample size is not given.,The description does not provide information on whether the study showed statistically significant results.

BETA & ABS,Counting on us: How start dates affect Census participation,2019,"The Census of Population and Housing (the Census) is the most comprehensive data 
collection exercise in Australia, involving around 10 million households and over 25 million 
people. Conducted every five years by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the Census 
provides valuable information on the social, economic and cultural characteristics of all 
Australians. 
Historically, the ABS directed people to complete the Census on a specific evening known as
‚ÄòCensus night‚Äô. To make it easier for people to engage with the 2021 Census, ABS advised 
people they now have a number of days ‚Äì or a ‚Äòresponse window‚Äô ‚Äì to complete the Census. 
Prior to making this change, ABS partnered with BETA to redesign the Census letter and test
two ways of presenting the response window to the public. The first version of the letter
included a response window of one week (‚Äúcomplete between 11 and 17 October‚Äù). The 
second version had an immediate response window (‚Äúcomplete between now and 17 
October‚Äù).
The ABS runs a number of Census Tests to refine processes ahead of the actual Census.
We used one of these Census Tests to run a randomised controlled trial to measure the 
impact of the two response windows. This Census Test took place in Wagga Wagga (NSW) 
and Logan (QLD) in October 2019. More than 26,000 households were randomly selected to
receive a letter with a ‚Äòcomplete now‚Äô or a ‚Äòcomplete between‚Äô response window. 
The proportion of households commencing and completing the Census Test was similar
regardless of which response window they saw. There was, however, a difference in when 
households commenced and completed their survey. Those who received the ‚Äôcomplete now‚Äô 
letter were more likely to commence the Census Test sooner. Those who received the 
‚Äôcomplete between‚Äô window were more likely to respond on, or just after, the Census Test
night. The ‚Äòcomplete now‚Äô variation effectively spread responses out over a longer period, 
reducing the administrative burden associated with collecting many responses on a single 
day. In particular, there were 26% fewer lodgements on Census Test night compared to the
‚Äòcomplete between‚Äô group. 
This research provides evidence that subtle wording changes to letters can impact the 
dynamics of survey commencement and completion by recipients. These findings contributed 
to ABS‚Äô decision to adopt the ‚Äòcomplete now‚Äô framing in the 2021 Census. 
In the 2021 Census, more people chose to complete the form earlier. Almost two thirds (63%) 
of households completed their form on or before Census day, compared to 45% in 2016. The 
overall response rate of the 2021 Census improved from 95.1% in 2016 to 96.1% in 2021. 
However, because ABS introduced a host of other public engagement initiatives ahead of the
2021 Census, we cannot attribute a single measure as the cause of the improved completion 
rate",ISBN 978-1-925364-96-5,Social and Health,,,,,,,,,Counting on us: How start dates affect Census participation | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,Original database,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A regular RCT,"26,000 households","The study did not explicitly mention statistically significant results.

BETA & Home Affairs,Increasing participation in the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP),2021,"Understanding English helps new migrants settle in Australia and participate socially, 
economically and politically. The Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) provides free 
English language tuition to migrants with less than a vocational level of English1. Not all 
migrants who are eligible for the AMEP currently enrol in it and those that do often disengage
before exhausting their eligibility.
BETA partnered with the Department of Home Affairs to conduct two trials to increase 
participation in the AMEP. We tested whether sending people translated information about 
the program would increase participation above the current practice of providing information 
in English. 
In the first trial we tested a letter and email in English and a letter and email in participants‚Äô 
home languages. We sent this material to 16,990 people with eligible visas who arrived in 
Australia between 1 July 2017 and 31 December 2020 who had not previously enrolled in the 
AMEP. 
In the second trial, we tested a text message in either English or in the participants‚Äô home 
languages coming from either Home Affairs or their former AMEP provider. We sent the 
message to 26,113 AMEP students who had disengaged between 1 July 2017 and 
30 September 2021. 
Across the two trials 985 participants (re-)engaged with the AMEP. We found no difference in 
engagement with the AMEP between the groups who received the communication material in 
English and those who received it in their home languages across both trials. We also found

Home Affairs and those who received it from their provider.
We embedded links to the AMEP website in the emails and text messages. We found that 
people who received the translated text message were significantly more likely to click the 
link than those who received the English text message. Similarly, participants who received 
the text message from Home Affairs were more likely to click the link than those who received
the message from their former AMEP provider.
The two trials suggest short, electronic communication to migrants about enrolling in the 
AMEP can be sent in English. However, for longer documents, hard-copy documents and 
documents that require deeper processing and analytical thinking, we recommend translating 
them into people‚Äôs home languages to ensure they are fully understood. Similarly, if the aim

Sustainability Victoria,Victorian Healthy Homes Trial,2022,"The Victorian Healthy Homes Program was a randomised controlled trial designed to measure the 
impact of an energy efficiency and thermal comfort home upgrade on temperature, energy use, health
and quality of life. Analysis indicated that a relatively minor upgrade (average $2,809) had wideranging benefits over the winter period. Average indoor temperature was increased by 0.33oC, with 
increases particularly strong in the morning, when temperatures are lowest. Exposure to cold 
temperatures (<18oC) was reduced by 43 minutes per day. Subjective experience of warmth is 
important; it does not always match temperature measurements. Householders in the intervention 
group were more than twice as likely as controls to report that their home felt warmer over winter. 
These gains in thermal comfort were obtained despite a significant reduction in gas use in upgraded 
homes, and no change in electricity use. There was no evidence of a rebound effect, with intervention 
participants less likely than controls to use their main heater and less likely to resort to other options 
to stay warm. Householders in the intervention group reported less condensation over winter. 
Importantly, the upgrade was associated with benefits in health, with reduced breathlessness, and 
improved quality of life, particularly its mental health and social care aspects. Health benefits of the 
upgrade were reflected in cost savings, with $887 per person saved in the healthcare system over the 
winter period. Cost-benefit analysis indicated that the upgrade would be cost-saving within 3 years ‚Äì
and would yield a net saving of $4,783 over 10 years ‚Äì due to savings in both energy and health.

DEWR,Online Employment Services Trial (OEST) Evaluation,2020,"About the Online Employment Services Trial
The Online Employment Services Trial (OEST) sought to test whether job seekers with Mutual 
Obligation Requirements (MORs) receiving employment services assistance through jobactive could 
effectively self-manage using an online platform. This included undertaking job search and meeting 
their MORs.
The OEST was offered for a maximum of six months to job seekers who were considered the most 
job-ready and who did not require any specialised assistance. Participants agreed to an online Job 
Plan designed to help them meet their MORs and accessed the jobactive website to search for jobs 
and report their job search efforts online.
Unlike those in provider-based servicing, OEST participants were not matched with an employment 
service provider; nor were they required to attend appointments. However, participants could opt 
out of OEST and transfer to jobactive provider-based services at any time by contacting the National 
Customer Service Line (NCSL) of the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (the 
department). Participants who had not left the service within six months were transferred from the 
OEST to provider-based services.
Key findings
Efficiency
‚Ä¢ OEST participants commenced services more quickly than the comparison group.
Sixty-two per cent of OEST participants commenced employment services on the day they were 
referred, compared to 10% of the comparison group.
‚Ä¢ Fewer than one in 10 OEST participants (9.3%) opted out of the OEST, either before or after 
commencement in the trial, with 3.8% opting out before commencement and 5.5% opting out 
after commencement. The main reasons job seekers expressed for opting out of the trial after 
commencement were a preference for face-to-face servicing (49%) and a lack of confidence in, 
or difficulty with, using computers or the internet (12%).
‚Ä¢ Opt-out rates were notably higher for participants aged 50 years or older, both prior to 
commencement (12%) and after commencement (9.8%). Participants without Year 12 and those 
living in outer regional areas also had higher opt-out rates.
Online Employment Services Trial Evaluation| 17
‚Ä¢ The majority of OEST participants were satisfied with the jobactive website (80%) and found the 
website functionality easy to use (83%).
‚Ä¢ OEST participants were as likely to incur no job search related demerit points as those in 
provider servicing.
Effectiveness
‚Ä¢ OEST participants in the quantitative research indicated higher levels of confidence than did 
those in the comparison group that the assistance they received would help them secure 
employment.
‚Ä¢ Over two-thirds of OEST participants in a longitudinal survey agreed that their skills in using the 
internet for job searches and applications had increased (70%) together with their job-seeking 
skills (68%).
‚Ä¢ OEST participants were more likely to report that their employment services were improving 
their chances of getting a job than the comparison group (63% versus 46%).
‚Ä¢ OEST participants were as likely to exit income support and employment services within 
six months of commencement as those receiving provider-based services (50% versus 52% and 
47% versus 47% respectively). This suggested that job-ready job seekers in online servicing can 
achieve similar employment outcomes to comparable job seekers in provider servicing. Given 
online servicing was provided at a lower cost than provider-based services, it was a more costeffective way of providing employment services to job-ready job seekers.
‚Ä¢ When exits within one month (four weeks) and three months (12 weeks) of service 
commencement were considered, OEST participants performed better than the comparison 
group.
‚Ä¢ However, OEST participants had poorer results than comparison job seekers after they 
transferred to provider servicing. After a nine-month period (including three months in provider 
servicing and a full six months in the OEST) trial participants were less likely to exit from income 
support and employment services (5.3% and 2.7% less respectively) than the comparison group. 
Potential explanations include participants finding the adjustment of transferring from OEST to 
provider servicing challenging, and a lack of financial incentives for jobactive providers to service 
Stream A entrants to their caseloads during the first 90 days (including former OEST
Online Employment Services Trial Evaluation| 18
participants).
2
It is also possible that provider servicing from the outset was more suitable for 
this cohort, perhaps due to undisclosed disadvantage or a lack of ability to self-manage their job 
search requirements.
‚Ä¢ Online servicing was as successful as provider servicing at maintaining exits from income 
support. Ninety-one per cent of the OEST group did not return to income support within 
six months following their exit date, compared with 89% of job seekers in the comparison group.
OEST participant experience
‚Ä¢ Seventy-one per cent of the OEST group were satisfied or very satisfied with online employment 
services and 8% were dissatisfied. The level of satisfaction with provider services for the 
comparison group was similar (67% and 14% respectively).
‚Ä¢ OEST participants identified various advantages of online employment servicing such as the 
convenience of being able to access services from home or other places (68%) and at their own 
time or after business hours (58%). Participants also agreed that not having to attend 
appointments with a jobactive provider was a significant advantage that gave them more time to 
look for work (50%).
‚Ä¢ Some cohorts of OEST participants reported difficulties with aspects of online servicing. These
participants tended to be older, had limited IT skills and/or did not have a computer at home.
This conforms with existing literature findings that identify age and low internet usage and/or 
access as factors impacting on digital exclusion.
‚Ä¢ jobactive providers interviewed for the evaluation expressed concern that online servicing was 
not suitable for certain Stream A job seekers. Providers also indicated that their experiences had 
shown that participants‚Äô barriers were not always disclosed. Providers noted that digital literacy
screening did not form part of the trial (this has since been developed and implemented as part 
of digital servicing).
2
jobactive providers were not eligible for an employment outcome payment if OEST participants who transferred from the 
trial were placed into employment within their first 90 days of the transfer. This is consistent with outcome payment 
arrangements for Stream A job seekers in jobactive.
Online Employment Services Trial Evaluation| 19
‚Ä¢ Feedback suggests that appropriate targeting of the eligibility criteria is a vital component of an 
effective online employment services model.
Summary
The evaluation found that online servicing is an efficient way to deliver employment services to the 
most job-ready participants, with only a small percentage of job seekers indicating difficulty in 
accessing or trusting the necessary website functionality.
The OEST was as effective as provider-based servicing in delivering employment services to the most 
job-ready job seekers. OEST participants were as likely as job seekers in the comparison group to exit 
employment services and income support within six months of commencement.
The majority of OEST participants were satisfied with OEST and the jobactive website, reflecting the 
quality of the online platform. Most respondents surveyed (from both the OEST and comparison 
groups) agreed that online services should be the default or ‚Äòfirst option‚Äô for providing employment 
services to job seekers who have just started looking for a job.
Given the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of online servicing, this evaluation provides evidence 
that supports the Government‚Äôs broad move towards digital services for the most job-ready job 
seekers. In particular, it provides firm evidence for rolling out the Online Employment Service in 
the 2020‚Äì21 Budget.
As online servicing is expanded over the coming years, it is important to ensure it is targeted at the 
most job-ready job seekers. Overall, the low opt-out rates and employment outcomes suggest 
eligibility was generally well targeted. However, the evaluation confirmed international and 
Australian research that job seekers most likely to experience difficulties with online employment 
servicing are those with low levels of digital literacy and lack of job search skills",,Employment,,,,,,,,,Online Employment Se...~https://www.dewr.gov.au/employment-services-evaluations/online-employment-services-trial-evaluation,,,Original database,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Unsure,The sample size is not given.,"The study did not explicitly mention statistically significant results.

DEWR,Utilising soft skills training to enhance work readiness,2022,"The Australian Government provides a range of support to help unemployed people into work. Many 
job seekers can find work relatively quickly and may only need basic support, such as help with job 
search. On the other hand, job seekers with more complex barriers to employment (and further 
education) will often require a significant change in personal circumstances and a conducive external 
economic environment to find work.
Time spent unsuccessfully looking for work can also erode individuals‚Äô confidence and reduce their 
motivation to search for work, compounding the existing barriers to employment. Long-term 
joblessness can therefore have scarring effects, resulting in a greater chance of future periods of 
unemployment, lower lifetime earnings and poorer physical and mental health.
This context highlights the potential benefits of government support that works with disadvantaged 
job seekers, often with long durations of unemployment, to recover and strengthen their work 
readiness. This improvement in work readiness may also complement other forms of employment 
assistance or other courses of action undertaken by the job seeker to find work.
Testing ‚Äòsoft skills‚Äô or work readiness training 
The Department of Education, Skills and Employment (the department) assesses the relative 
disadvantage of job seekers using the Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI), which is a 
questionnaire used to measure the risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Responses to a series of 
questions are used to help identify what level of support the job seeker will need to help them find 
work. Based on their JSCI scores and other supplementary assessments, job seekers are initially 
allocated to either Stream A (where job seekers are the most job ready) or Stream B (where job 
seekers need a greater level of support to help them become job ready). The JSCI also identifies 
whether a job seeker has multiple or complex barriers to employment that require more intensive 
support through Stream C.
The department‚Äôs Behavioural Economics Expertise Section set out to test a training solution to 
improve work readiness, with a particular focus on more disadvantaged job seekers in Stream B and 
C. The objectives for the solution included:
1. Initially build confidence, resilience and motivation to go out and find work.
2. Build on this by ensuring job seekers had the tools and resources they needed to find work, 
such as practical advice to improve their job search skills.
The department collaborated with Bounce Australia1
(Bounce) to help develop and deliver the 
training program. The training program incorporated techniques underpinned by behavioural 
insights, which helped job seekers make positive steps to building their confidence, self-esteem, 
resilience and life satisfaction. These psychological work readiness indicators can be thought as a
category of soft skills ‚Äì the other being more traditional forms of soft skills, such as communication

and teamwork skills. Specifically, the trial tested a 3-week training program aimed at maintaining 
and building job seeker‚Äôs soft skills, focusing on improving the psychological work readiness of 
Stream B and C job seekers.
A randomised controlled trial (RCT) methodology was used to assess the effectiveness of the 
training. To assess their change in soft skills over the course of the trial, job seekers were sent a soft 
skills assessment to complete prior to the trial and the same assessment after the trial. The 
assessment contained four different psychometric tools used to assess soft skills and psychological 
work readiness (32 questions). The trial ran from March 2019 to December 2019 and involved 319 
job seekers.
Our key findings
Overall, the trial found the training to be beneficial for Stream B and C job seekers, having a positive 
and statistically significant impact on their life satisfaction, self-esteem and resilience2
. Table 1 
illustrates the number of job seekers that moved from low levels self-esteem, resilience and life 
satisfaction to higher levels after attending the training.
Table 1: Key findings

Self-esteem Low to Average or High 39 47.6
Self-esteem Average to High 14 9.9
Resilience Low to Average or High 51 50.5
Resilience Average to High 7 5.7
Note: Percentage change is calculated by dividing the number of job seekers who moved into a higher scoring bracket 
following the training by the base number of job seekers in that group after the pre-intervention survey. For example, 
there were 85 job seekers who had low life satisfaction after completing the pre-intervention survey. Of that, 44 job 
seekers increased their life satisfaction to average or high in the post-intervention survey, equalling a 51.8 per cent change.
These findings suggest improvements to the precursors to employment, or job seekers‚Äô 
psychological work readiness, are possible by utilising soft skills training. Particularly when 
implemented alongside other tailored support, such as occupational3
, foundation and job search 
skills, this may help disadvantaged job seekers maintain or build the confidence and positive habits 
that lead to a return to employment (Koopman et al, 2017). That is, increased self-esteem, resilience 
and life satisfaction in turn may improve job search effectiveness and therefore the likelihood of 
employment4

DEWR,Applying Behavioural Economics to Increase the Take-up of Wage Subsidies Report,2018,"Executive Summary
Wage subsidies are payments to encourage businesses to employ eligible job seekers.
In 2016, the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT), the Applied and Behavioural Economics Section and the 
Incentives and Investments Branch of the Australian Government Department of Jobs and Small 
Business (formerly the Department of Employment, furthermore referred to as the Department), in 
partnership with jobactive employment services provider Mission Providence, co-designed and 
implemented a behavioural economics trial with the aim of increasing the take-up of Australian 
Government wage subsidies.
The early research phases of the project identified three main areas for improvement in the way wage 
subsidies were delivered: (i) administrative complexities for both jobactive providers and employers; (ii) 
financial incentives for employers not being framed correctly; and (iii) social incentives not being taken 
into consideration as a complement to the payments.
The new behavioural economics trial did not change the amount of the subsidies or the policy, but 
rather looked at testing small changes, including:
improving administrative processes, by making wage subsidy agreements easier for employers to 
understand and allowing them to sign online with an electronic signature;
restructuring of payment instalments to increase attractiveness and enhance loss aversion of 
employers; and 
improving communication and marketing materials for jobactive staff to promote wage subsidies 
to job seekers and employers.
The new approach was tested across five of Mission Providence‚Äôs sites in South West Sydney, on a 
sample of 1,436 employers, between 25 July 2016 and 1 November 2016. The effectiveness of the new
approach was evaluated using a cluster Randomised Control Trial, with a stepped-wedge design.
We found that our trial caused an increase in the number of wage subsidy agreements signed. 
Specifically, an additional two agreements were signed per month at each site. While the higher level of 
agreements signed is associated with higher average hours worked per placement (an average of two 
hours per week per wage subsidy), there was also a small reduction in the likelihood of being employed 
for four weeks, 12 weeks and 26 weeks. However, apart from the average hours worked per placement, 
these differences were not significant at conventional levels. The intervention also resulted in a 
reduction in the time taken to finalise an agreement (from an average of 17 to 11 days), although this 
did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. We also found a large and statistically 
significant increase in promotional activity by 60 per cent.
These results suggest that the intervention was effective in increasing the number of wage subsidy 
agreements signed online, but due to a lower than expected sample size, our trial ultimately did not 
allow us to be more definitive about the efficacy of the changes made.
The insights and results from this trial show how financial incentives per se might often not be sufficient 
if not informed by how individuals really behave. Based on an improved understanding of employers‚Äô 
preferences and jobactive provider staff behaviour, this trial shows that small changes to the existing 
policy can have a significant effect.
Feedback received during the trial fine-tuned the final design and implementation of operational policy 
changes to wage subsidies announced in the 2016 Budget and implemented nationally on 
1 January 2017. These include:
Giving employers longer to sign up to an agreement: wage subsidy agreements can be signed up 
to 12 weeks after the job starting, extended from four weeks.
Making the application and payment processes easier: improving online functionality for 
employers and providers to simplify eligibility, agreements and claim processes.
Providing more timely financial support: a discretionary kickstart payment option of up to 
40 per cent can be made four weeks after the job seeker starts in the job.
All wage subsidies paid to employers over six months instead of the previous 12 months.
Increasing flexibility for employers and job seekers: moving to an average of 20 hours worked per 
week over the six month agreement rather than a minimum requirement of 15 hours per week 
worked",,Employment,,,,,,,,,Applying Behavioural...~https://www.dewr.gov.au/employment-research-and-statistics/resources/applying-behavioural-economics-increase-take-wage-subsidies,,,Original database,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,"A cluster Randomised Control Trial, with a stepped-wedge design.","1,436","The study did not show statistically significant results for most outcomes.

ATO,Testing deliberate choice letters to increase tax compliance,2023,"In the Australian Income Tax system, individual taxpayers are entitled to claim deductions for expenses 
incurred while earning salary and wage income. These deductions are called work related expenses. 
According to Taxation Statistics, work related expense deductions grew by 15 per cent from 2010-11 to 
2015 16. In 2015-16, 8.6 million taxpayers claimed nearly $22 billion in work related expense deductions. 
There is evidence that claims for work-related expense deductions can be erroneous and there is a 
propensity to over claim, including in returns prepared by tax agents. In his National Press Club address on 
5 July 2017, the Commissioner of Taxation expressed concern about the accuracy of work-related expense 
claims related to work, clothing and vehicles in the 2014-15 financial year. While individual amounts overclaimed can be small, the sum and overall revenue impact is significant. The Commissioner estimated the 
overall revenue impact was in the vicinity of $2.5 billion. 
Research by H&R Block in 2016 indicated one in five taxpayers believed misrepresentation of tax return 
information isn‚Äôt so bad, and 71 per cent believed they could claim something they were not entitled to 
(Lonergan Research 2016). PhD research (Wurth 2013) found tax agents rated their clients‚Äô work-related 
expense claims as the ‚Äòleast compliant‚Äô label on the tax return. Behavioural insights offers a low-cost tool to 
address these behaviours and underlying attitudes and help taxpayers willingly comply with the tax system. 
The Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government (BETA) partnered with the Australian 
Taxation Office (ATO) to examine the extent to which behaviourally-informed communications to tax agents 
could reduce erroneous work related expense claims. In particular, we tested the effectiveness of a letter 
sent to tax agents drawing on behavioural insights to address social norms.
We used a randomised controlled trial to test the impact of sending this letter to tax agents whose clients 
had higher than expected work-related expense claims compared to their peers. The letter specifically 
identified each agent‚Äôs clients who had lodged higher than expected claims (referred to as ‚Äòidentified 
clients‚Äô). There were over 2,000 tax agents in the trial, who were randomly assigned to a letter group or a 
‚Äòno letter‚Äô control group.
17 per cent of agents in the letter group lodged amendments, compared with 1 per cent of agents in the ‚Äòno 
letter‚Äô group. On average, identified clients represented by agents in the letter group reduced their work 
related expense claims by $191, compared with a $2 increase in the ‚Äòno letter‚Äô group. Overall, identified 
clients reduced their work-related expense claims by a total of $2.2 million. If we had sent the letter to all 
agents in the trial, including those who did not receive a letter, we expect this simple messaging 
intervention would have decreased work related expense deductions by about $4.4 million.
The letter led to an increase in the average total tax paid per client of $76, for a total of $0.9 million. If we 
had sent the letter to all agents in the trial, total tax revenue would have increased by an estimated $1.7 
million. We cannot be sure about the contribution of the reduction in work-related expense claims to the 
increase in tax paid, because amendments to tax return labels other than work-related expenses could 
have influenced the net tax position. 
Overall, these findings indicate low-cost, well-targeted and well-designed communications incorporating 
behavioural insights are effective in reducing erroneous work-related expense claims although the length of 
time for which this behavioural change is sustained remains unknown",,Tax,,,,,,,,,https://iorder.com.au/publication/Download.aspx?ProdID=1-XCZ3YO9-P1,,,Original database,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,"Over 2,000 tax agents.","Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Tseng et al,Early Years Education Program,"2017, 2018, 2019, 2019, 2022","Overview of main findings
This report presents findings on the impact on children 
and their primary caregivers of 24 months of enrolment in 
the Early Years Education Program (EYEP). After 24 months 
the impact of attending EYEP on children and their 
families is broad and powerful. Large positive impacts of 
EYEP are found on children‚Äôs cognitive and non-cognitive 
development ‚Äì primarily IQ, protective factors related to 
resilience and social-emotional development. There is also 
some evidence that EYEP improves children‚Äôs language 
skills and lowers the psychological distress of their 
primary caregivers. 
EYEP and the research trial
EYEP is a centre-based, early years care and education 
program targeted at the needs of children who 
are exposed to significant family stress and social 
disadvantage, including being at heightened risk of, or 
having experienced, abuse and neglect. The program 
has a dual focus: to address the consequences of family 
stress on children‚Äôs development and to redress learning 
deficiencies. The ultimate objective of EYEP is to ensure 
that at-risk and vulnerable children realise their full 
potential, and arrive at school developmentally equal to 
their peers and equipped to be successful learners. 
Children who participate in EYEP are offered three years 
of care and education (50 weeks per year, five hours per 
day each week). Key features of EYEP are high staff/child 
ratios, qualified and experienced staff, inclusion of an infant 
mental health consultant as a member of the staff, and a 
rigorously developed curriculum. 
The impact of EYEP is being evaluated through a 
Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) as part of the Early Years 
Education Research Program (EYERP); otherwise referred to 
in this report as the ‚ÄòEYEP trial‚Äô. Children for whom consent 
was given to participate in the EYEP trial were randomly 
assigned into either an intervention group who were 
enrolled in EYEP or to a control group. Estimates of the 
impact of EYEP on children and their primary caregivers 
are derived from comparisons of outcomes between 
the groups. 
Characteristics of children and primary caregivers in 
the EYEP trial
To be eligible for the EYEP trial, children had to be aged 
less than 36 months at the time of entry to the trial, 
assessed as having two or more risk factors as defined in 
the Department of Human Services 2007 Best Interest Case 
Practice Model, be currently engaged with family services 
or child protection services and have early education as 
part of their care plan. 
The eligibility criteria enabled the selection of a group 
of participants in the EYEP trial for whom the program 
was designed ‚Äì children with substantial developmental 
delay living in families experiencing high levels of stress 
(Tseng et al., 2017). Compared with a general population 
of children, participants in the EYEP trial are highly 
disadvantaged on a variety of dimensions. EYEP trial 
participants had lower birth weight and, at the time of 
entry to the trial, had compromised development of 
IQ, language skills, motor skills and adaptive behaviour. 
The primary caregivers of children in the EYEP trial have 
lower levels of labour force engagement and family 
income, are more likely to experience stressful events 
and have higher levels of psychological distress than the 
general population of caregivers.
Outcomes
The main objective of the EYEP trial is to test whether 
the program is meeting its goal to improve children‚Äôs 
cognitive and non-cognitive skills (Jordan et al., 2014, p. 3). 
Outcomes relating to children‚Äôs cognitive skills (IQ and 
language skills) and their non-cognitive skills (within-child 
protective factors related to resilience and social-emotional 
development) are therefore examined. Possible impacts of 
EYEP on primary caregivers are evaluated using outcomes 
4 Report on impact of EYEP after 24 months
relating to perceptions of the level of stress they are 
experiencing and the quality of home environment. 
Sample size
A total of 145 children were recruited to the EYEP trial. 
These children come from 99 families. There are 72 children 
who are in the intervention group and 73 in the control 
group, and respectively 50 and 49 families in those groups. 
There are 64 girls and 81 boys in the trial. 
Over time, there has been attrition from the group of 
145 children who were originally recruited to the EYEP trial. 
The data collection at 24 months, on which the analysis 
in this report primarily relies, obtained responses from 
104 children and their primary caregivers. In addition, 
it was not possible to collect a complete set of data on 
outcomes for all these 104 children and primary caregivers. 
Hence, the analysis of the impact of EYEP on outcomes at 
24 months is based on samples that usually consist of 85 to 
95 children or primary caregivers.
Empirical method
Initial random assignment of participants in the EYEP trial 
achieved balance in the characteristics of the intervention 
and control groups. However, due to subsequent attrition 
of participants from the trial, by the time data were 
collected on outcomes at 24 months, several characteristics 
were no longer balanced. Some characteristics which 
are unbalanced are likely to affect children‚Äôs outcomes at 
24 months. Hence, it is not possible to estimate the impact 
of EYEP simply by comparing the average outcomes for 
children in the intervention and control groups. Instead, 
for the estimated impact of EYEP to reflect only the effect 
of participation in the program, it is necessary to use 
empirical methods that can correct for differences in 
characteristics between the groups. For this study we have 
applied two alternative methods to estimate the impact 
of EYEP ‚Äì a regression method and a propensity score 
matching method. 
What is the ‚Äòimpact‚Äô of EYEP that is estimated in 
this study?
The impact of EYEP is estimated for children who attended 
the program for at least 60 days over 24 months (out of 
a possible total of approximately 480 days). We restrict 
our attention to this sample in order that all children in 
the intervention group have had a level of exposure to 
EYEP that could conceivably be expected to affect their 
development. This is the same approach as was taken in 
estimating the impact of EYEP after twelve months (Tseng 
et al., 2018).
The impact of EYEP on outcomes for children after 
24 months is likely to derive from two sources: first, 
children in the intervention group receiving a larger 
number of hours of early years care and education 
services than the control group (for example, over the first 
24 months, children enrolled in EYEP received an average 
of 20.4 hours per week of formal early years care and 
education compared with 15.7 hours per week for children 
in the control group); and second, differences between the 
design and attributes of EYEP and the services received by 
the control group. 
Main findings
Large and statistically significant EYEP impacts are found 
at 24 months for several outcomes for children: (i) IQ; (ii) 
protective factors related to resilience; and (iii) socialemotional development. There is also a relatively large 
impact on children‚Äôs language skills, but this estimate has 
limited statistical significance. 
The estimated impact on IQ is one-third to one-half of a 
standard deviation. This compares with average impacts on 
IQ from early years demonstration programs in the United 
States of about one-quarter of a standard deviation. The 
estimated impact on within-child protective factors related 
to resilience is about one-third of a standard deviation. The 
proportion of children enrolled in EYEP who are classified 
in the clinical range for social-emotional development is 
lower by 30 percentage points compared with the control 
group, a substantial impact. 
Evidence that EYEP is having an impact on the stress 
experienced by primary caregivers is emerging at 
24 months. Primary caregivers of children in EYEP show 
a reduced level of distress on the Kessler Psychological 
Distress K6 Scale (K6) of about 1.5 points (on a zero to 
30 points scale), which is marginally statistically significant. 
Participation in EYEP is also estimated to be associated 
with small decreases in the frequency (one point on zero 
to 80 points scale) and in intensity (three points on zero 
to 100 points scale) of parenting daily hassles, but these 
estimates are not statistically significant. The estimated 
Report on impact of EYEP after 24 months 5
impact of EYEP on the home environment is small and not 
statistically significant. 
Major differences are apparent in the impact of EYEP on 
boys and girls ‚Äì especially for non-cognitive skills. For 
children‚Äôs IQ and language skills the estimated impacts 
are larger and have higher levels of statistical significance 
for boys than girls. For protective factors related to 
resilience a large and highly significant impact is found 
for boys, compared to a zero impact for girls. By contrast, 
the estimated impact of EYEP on social-emotional 
development exhibits the opposite pattern, with a much 
larger impact for girls than boys. Impacts on outcomes for 
primary caregivers at 24 months are confined to families 
with girls enrolled in EYEP. For the primary caregivers of 
girls there is a decrease in psychological distress and in 
the frequency of parenting hassles. There is, however, no 
evidence of an impact on these outcomes for the primary 
caregivers of boys. 
The timing of the impact of EYEP over the first 24 months 
has varied across outcomes. The impact of EYEP on children‚Äôs 
IQ appears to have been concentrated in the initial twelve 
months of the program, as the estimated impact size does 
not change appreciably between twelve months and 
24 months. This result is consistent with evidence from 
previous trials of early years demonstration programs in the 
United States. Other outcomes for children show a more 
pronounced impact from EYEP after the second year of 
being enrolled in the program. The estimated impact on 
children‚Äôs language skills increases from zero after twelve 
months to about three to four points after 24 months. For 
protective factors related to resilience the estimated impact 
size after 24 months is two to three times larger than after 
twelve months. While distinguishing the exact timing of 
impact on social-emotional development is difficult, there 
does seem to have been a positive impact spread across 
both the first and second years of the program. Where there 
have been positive outcomes for primary caregivers, these 
have been concentrated in the second year of their child‚Äôs 
enrolment in EYEP",,Early years,,,,,,,,,Changing children's ...~https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/research/education/early-years-education,,,Original database,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,145,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

"Ilya Klauzner, Suzanne Poynton, Don Weatherburn and Hamish Thorburn",The Youth on Track randomised trial,2022,"Background
Youth on Track is an early intervention scheme that was introduced in 2013 to help reduce the risk of young people re-offending. The scheme assigns young people to caseworkers for up to 12 months. Caseworkers administer interventions to the young person, including cognitive-behavioural and family interventions. They can also refer young people to external services to address criminogenic needs and engage with schools to increase attendance. Youth on Track is only available in seven sites in NSW and for young people who have never had a supervised order.

Between August 2017 and June 2020, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) was implemented to evaluate the Youth on Track program. A brief intervention called Fast Track was created as the control arm to ensure some level of treatment for all young people participating in the RCT. Fast Track was capped at six weeks of case management. Caseworkers did not deliver any structured interventions to the young person, but could refer them to external services.
We examined whether there were any differences in recidivism, education, employment, community activity, and housing outcomes between Youth on Track and Fast Track participants.

Key findings
For both the 12- and 24-month follow-up periods, there were no statistically significant differences between Youth on Track and Fast Track, in the proportion of young people who reoffended or entered custody. After adjusting for important characteristics, we estimate that 48.2% of Fast Track participants reoffended within 12 months compared with 50.6% of Youth on Track participants. Youth on Track participants were 3.2 percentage points less likely to reoffend and 3.5 percentage points less likely to enter custody within 24 months, but these differences were not statistically significant. We found that in certain subgroups, Youth on Track participants had much larger reductions in offending and custody.

We also found that Youth on Track participants were 6.2 percentage points more likely to be in employment at the end of their program and worked one hour more each week, on average, compared with Fast Track participants. Youth on Track participants were also 1.5 percentage points less likely to be in out-of-home care at program exit. Both these differences were statistically significant. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of school attendance, involvement in community activities or stable accommodation at program exit.

Conclusion
Youth on Track participants had similar reoffending and custody rates to Fast Track participants. Variability in the implementation of the scheme across sites and over time may partially explain these effects. Further research should be undertaken to examine the efficacy of key aspects of the program, including the risk assessment tool and behavioural intervention.",,,,,,,,,,,https://bocsar.nsw.gov.au/research-evaluations/2022/cjb249-summary-youth-on-track.html,,,Original database,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,The study showed statistically significant results in two areas: Youth on Track participants were 6.2 percentage points more likely to be in employment at the end,Justice; Education; Employment; Housing / homelessness
"Sara Rahman, Suzanne Poynton, Don Weatherburn",The NSW Rolling List Court Evaluation ,2017,"Aim
To assess whether the application of an alternative court model with fixed teams of lawyers operating on a rolling basis in the NSW District Criminal Court resulted in greater efficiency in the resolution of indictable criminal matters relative to the regular operation of the NSW District Court, and to identify the successful elements and mechanisms of the Rolling List Court (RLC) model.
 
Method
A randomised controlled trial was conducted in the NSW District Criminal Court (NSW DCC), where eligible matters were balloted with 50:50 odds to the RLC or the general list of the NSW DCC. The proportion of early guilty pleas relative to late guilty pleas, trials reaching a verdict and no-bills were compared between the courts, and survival analysis was used to analyse the time taken to reach a guilty plea and to finalise matters in both courts. Stakeholder interviews were conducted to identify the key mechanisms behind the RLC, as well as any other benefits or drawbacks of the model.
 
Results
More than half (58.0 %) of the matters balloted to the RLC resolved in a guilty plea before the trial date, compared to 22.0 per cent of the matters randomised to the general list of the NSW DCC. There were marked improvements in the average time taken to reach a guilty plea (t=-3.43; p-value<.001), to list matters for trial (t=-5.14; p-value<.001) and to finalise matters (t=-3.93; p-value<.001) in the RLC. Further evidence of faster resolution in the RLC was found through survival analyses of the time taken to reach a guilty plea (HR=1.73; 95% CI (1.08, 2.78); p-value=.023) and to finalise matters (HR=1.90; 95% CI (1.29, 2.79); p-value=.001). Stakeholders interviewed indicated that early briefing and negotiation was crucial to obtaining earlier guilty pleas, and further benefits to efficiency arose from the fixed-team composition of the court.
 
Conclusion
The RLC proved effective at obtaining early guilty pleas and reducing delay in the processing of indictable criminal matters. The findings suggest that efforts to introduce some elements of the RLC, such as early briefing of practitioners and pre-trial negotiations, could have benefits for the NSW DCC's efficiency.",,Crime and justice,,,,,,,,,https://bocsar.nsw.gov.au/documents/publications/cjb/cjb201-250/cjb208-report-the-nsw-rolling-list-court-evaluation-fianl-report.pdf,,,Original database,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Champion et al,Health4Life eHealth intervention to modify multiple lifestyle risk behaviours among adolescent students in Australia: a cluster-randomised controlled trial,2023,"Lifestyle risk behaviours are prevalent among adolescents and commonly co-occur, but current intervention approaches tend to focus on single risk behaviours. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the eHealth intervention Health4Life in modifying six key lifestyle risk behaviours (ie, alcohol use, tobacco smoking, recreational screen time, physical inactivity, poor diet, and poor sleep, known as the Big 6) among adolescents.
Methods
We conducted a cluster-randomised controlled trial in secondary schools that had a minimum of 30 year 7 students, in three Australian states. A biostatistician randomly allocated schools (1:1) to Health4Life (a six-module, web-based programme and accompanying smartphone app) or an active control group (usual health education) with the Blockrand function in R, stratified by site and school gender composition. All students aged 11‚Äì13 years who were fluent in English and attended participating schools were eligible. Teachers, students, and researchers were not masked to allocation. Primary outcomes were alcohol use, tobacco use, recreational screen time, moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sugar-sweetened beverage intake, and sleep duration at 24 months, measured by self-report surveys, and analysed in all students who were eligible at baseline. Latent growth models estimated between-group change over time. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12619000431123).
Findings
Between April 1, 2019, and Sept 27, 2019, we recruited 85 schools (9280 students), of which 71 schools with 6640 eligible students (36 schools [3610 students] assigned to the intervention and 35 [3030 students] to the control) completed the baseline survey. 14 schools were excluded from the final analysis or withdrew, mostly due to a lack of time. We found no between-group differences for alcohol use (odds ratio 1¬∑24, 95% CI 0¬∑58‚Äì2¬∑64), smoking (1¬∑68, 0¬∑76‚Äì3¬∑72), screen time (0¬∑79, 0¬∑59‚Äì1¬∑06), MVPA (0¬∑82, 0¬∑62‚Äì1¬∑09), sugar-sweetened beverage intake (1¬∑02, 0¬∑82‚Äì1¬∑26), or sleep (0¬∑91, 0¬∑72‚Äì1¬∑14) at 24 months.

Program Description
Program Goals
The Reintegrative Shaming Experiments (RISE) in Canberra, Australia, were designed to measure the impact of ‚Äúrestorative policing‚Äù on both victims and the person who committed the offenses‚Äô perceptions of justice, as well as overall satisfaction following the conference. The experiments also investigated the impact of restorative justice diversionary practices, particularly those that used the Wagga Wagga conference model, on repeat offending. The ultimate goal of the conference is to repair the harm caused by the offense by bringing together the person who committed the offense, victim, and members of the community in a way that allows convicted persons to reintegrate into the community, and victims to return to their normal routines without fear of further victimization.

Program Theory
Restorative justice places both the victim and the person who committed the offense at the center of the framework, allowing the victim to express the harm caused, while allowing the person who committed the offense to take responsibility for his or her actions and make amends for the future. It is believed that a conference, which brings together the person who committed the offense, victim, and supportive individuals for both parties, is a less stigmatizing environment for person who committed the offense. Some scholars believe that conventional criminal justice process stigmatizes the person who committed the offense as an ‚Äúother,‚Äù excluding him or her and hindering the reintegration process. Therefore, it is believed that the reintegrative shaming process used in restorative justice conferences could have a far greater impact on the reoffending rate, as it expresses disapproval of their actions, yet offers support and belief in the individual for the future (Braithwaite 1989). Likewise, victims will have a more positive perception of justice and less fear of re-victimization by participating in restorative justice conferences, as they are able to have a voice in the process (Braithwaite and Mugford 1994). 

Program Components
The RISE experiments were conducted to test the impact of reintegrative shaming conferences used in restorative justice. Diversionary conferencing, particularly the Wagga Wagga model investigated in the RISE experiments, typically lasts 1‚Äì2 hours. During this time the person who committed the offense, victim, and supportive individuals for both parties discuss the crime, its impact, and reach an agreement on how the individual can make amends for the future. The Wagga Wagga model is different than other diversionary conferences in that the conference coordinator and facilitator is a police officer, and the conference is held at a police station; other diversionary conferences are held by non-police coordinators and facilitators at various other locations. In contrast to other restorative justice models, the Wagga Wagga conference model also used a great deal of reintegrative shaming.

The RISE experiments included those who had committed four types of offenses: drinking and driving, juvenile property offenses, juvenile shoplifting offenses, and youth violent offenses. The aim of the project was to include ‚Äúmiddle range‚Äù offenses, neither so trivial that they would normally be dealt with by a simple caution or warning, nor so serious that the police would be reluctant to bypass the court system in favor of an experimental alternative (serious, sexual, and domestic violence offenses were excluded).

Evaluation Outcomes
Study 1
Shoplifting Rate
There was no statistically significant difference found between the treatment and control groups in shoplifting rate.

Property Offense Rate
There was no statistically significant difference found between the treatment and control groups in property offense rate.

Violent Offense Rate
Sherman, Strang, and Woods (2000) found that participants in the diversionary conferencing treatment group had a lower rate of violent offenses, compared with the control group, at the one-year follow up. This difference was statistically significant.

Drinking and Driving Rate
Treatment group participants had a higher rate of drunk driving, compared with the control group at the one-year follow up. This difference was statistically significant.

Study 2
Self-Reported Belief in the Legitimacy of Law
Participants in the treatment group reported a greater belief in the legitimacy of the law, compared with the control group. This difference was statistically significant.

Police-Reported Recidivism
Tyler and colleagues (2007) found no statistically significant difference between participants in the diversionary conferencing treatment group and the control group in police-reported recidivism at the 2-year follow up.

Self-Reported Effort to Not Drive Drunk
Participants in the treatment group reported a greater effort to not drive drunk, compared with the control group. This difference was statistically significant.

Self-Reported Drinking and Driving
There was no statistically significant difference found between treatment and control groups in self-reported drunk driving.

Self-Reported Attitude Toward Reoffending
Participants in the treatment group were more likely to report that reoffending would have great impacts on their personal lives, compared with the control group. This difference was statistically significant.

Evaluation Methodology
Study 1
Sherman, Strang, and Woods (2000) investigated the recidivism behavior of individuals involved in diversionary restorative justice conferences. The Reintegrative Shaming Experiments (RISE) randomly assigned cases, rather than person who committed the offense, to either the treatment condition (conference) or to conventional court processing. A ‚Äúcase‚Äù was defined as all of the individuals who were apprehended together for the same criminal offense. Both males and females were included in the study, with an age range of 15‚Äì29. RISE took place between 1995 and 2000 in Canberra, Australia. New cases were accepted until July 1, 2000.

In this study, four offenses were analyzed: drinking and driving, juvenile property offenses, juvenile shoplifting offenses, and youth violent offenses.

Drinking and driving was defined as having blood alcohol content over .08. The drinking and driving subset consisted of 900 cases, with 900 individuals (450 for court processing and 450 for diversionary conferencing).
Juvenile property offenses was defined as offending with personal victims committed by persons under the age of 18, and included offenses such as theft, burglary, auto crime, or criminal damage. The juvenile property offending-personal victims subset included 162 cases, with 238 individuals (114 for court processing and 124 for diversionary conferencing).
Juvenile shoplifting offenses were offenses committed by individuals under the age of 18 and were detected by security staff. The juvenile shoplifting offenses subset consisted of 108 cases, with 135 individuals (62 for court processing and 73 for diversionary conferencing).
Youth violent offenses were offenses committed by individuals under the age of 30, and included offenses such as common assault or aggravated assault. The youth violence subset sample included 89 cases, with 110 individuals (52 for court processing and 58 for diversionary conferencing).
Repeat offending was calculated using criminal history data from the Australian Federal Police. This data includes the criminal trajectories of all individuals in each of the four offense categories. Most, but not all, offense categories included at least a 1-year follow-up period. The analysis examined before‚Äìafter differences in offending rates between the treatment and comparison groups. One limitation of the experiment is that it did not control for the person who committed the crime and victim differences within the offense categories. Therefore, preexisting differences could have impacted any similarities or differences both within offense categories, as well as between the control and experimental conditions. No subgroup analyses were conducted.

Study 2
Tyler and colleagues (2007) also used data from the RISE experiments to analyze the impact of restorative justice conferencing, specifically the reintegrative shaming aspect of the Wagga Wagga conference model, on recidivism and measures of support for the law. However, Tyler and colleagues only used data from the drinking and driving portion of the earlier study in their analysis. In this study, all participants were arrested between July 1995 and December 1997, with the majority of individuals arrested as a result of police conducting random breathalyzer tests in Canberra, Australia. A randomized design was used, with individuals randomly assigned to the restorative justice conference or traditional court processing (the control).

The impact of the restorative justice conferencing was analyzed using three different methods: an interview with them shortly following the conference or court processing regarding their experience; a follow-up interview with them two years after the conference or court processing regarding their experience; and the analysis of police records four years prior and four years following the conference or court processing.

Of the 900 individuals included in this study, 730 were interviewed shortly after the conference or court processing, with 377 individuals from the treatment condition and 353 from the control condition. Two years later, 620 individuals were interviewed regarding their experience, which included 313 individuals from the treatment condition and 307 from the control condition. Finally, police records included criminal activity for all 900 individuals four years prior and four years following the conference or court processing.

The first interview was conducted to investigate their experience in the conference or court processing. In this interview, they were asked to make judgments on the fairness of the conference or court processing, the fairness of police treatment, and the legitimacy of the legal system. The second interview, conducted two years after the conference or court processing, investigated their law-related attitudes. These interviews focused on their belief in the legitimacy of the law and the obligation they felt to obey the law, as well as the problems they believed breaking the law would create for their family or community. No subgroup analyses were conducted.",,Crime and justice,,,,,,,,,13 Nov 2017 - Austra...~https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/awa/20171112233316/http://www.aic.gov.au/criminal_justice_system/rjustice/rise/recidivism.html,,,Original database,"Tyler, T., Lawrence S., Heather S., Barnes, G. and Woods, D.

The primary trial outcome was the proportion of services intending to adopt the Guidelines, defined as intention to; (i) offer an indoor-outdoor program for the full day; or (ii) offer more outdoor play time. Secondary outcomes included awareness, reach, knowledge and implementation of the Guidelines. Barriers to Guideline implementation, cost of the dissemination strategies and analytic data to measure fidelity of intervention delivery were also captured. Results: Of the 154 services that provided post-intervention data, 58 received the e-newsletter (37.7%), 50 received the animated video (32.5%), and 46 received the control (29.9%). Services who received the animated video had nearly five times the odds (OR: 4.91 [1.03, 23.34] p = 0.046) than those in the control group, to report having intentions to adopt the Guidelines. There were no statistically significant differences in awareness or knowledge of the Guidelines between either intervention or control services. Development costs were greatest for the animated video. The extent to which the dissemination strategy was viewed in full, were similar for both the e-newsletter and animated video. Conclusion: This study found potential for the inclusion of interactive strategies to disseminate policy and guideline information within the ECEC setting, in the context of the need for rapid communication. Further research should explore the added benefits of embedding such strategies within a multi-strategy intervention.

In a previous study, providing Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHSs) with training and support increased the odds of clients receiving AUDIT-C alcohol screening. A follow-up study found that these results were maintained for at least two years, but there was large variability in the effectiveness of the intervention between services. In this study, we use services that previously received support as a comparison group to test whether training and support can improve alcohol screening and brief intervention rates among wait-list control ACCHSs. Methods: Design: Cluster randomised trial using routinely collected health data. Setting: Australia. Cases: Twenty-two ACCHSs that see at least 1000 clients a year and use Communicare as their practice management software. Intervention and comparator: After initiating support, we compare changes in screening and brief intervention between wait-list control services and services that had previously received support. Measurement: Records of AUDIT-C screening and brief intervention activity in routinely collected data. Results: During the reference period we observed 357,257 instances where one of 74,568 clients attended services at least once during a two-monthly data extraction period. Following the start of support, the odds of screening (OR = 0.94 [95% CI 0.67, 1.32], p = 0.74, 0.002) and brief intervention (OR = 1.43 [95% CI 0.69, 2.95], p = 0.34, 0.002) did not improve for the wait-list control group, relative to comparison services. Conclusions: We did not replicate the finding that support and training improves AUDIT-C screening rates with wait-list control data. The benefits of support are likely context dependent. Coincidental policy changes may have sensitised services to the effects of support in the earlier phase of the study. Then the COVID-19 pandemic may have made services less open to change in this latest phase. Future efforts could include practice software prompts to alcohol screening and brief intervention, which are less reliant on individual staff time or resources.

Drew N.; McAllister M.; Coffin J.; Robinson M.; Katzenellenbogen J.; Armstrong E.,Healing Right Way randomised control trial enhancing rehabilitation services for Aboriginal people with brain injury in Western Australia: translation principles and activities,2024,"Background. This report provides the theory, method and practice of culturally secure translation and knowledge exchange in the Healing Right Way Clinical Trial (2017√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì2022), outlining activities to date. Healing Right Way was a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in Western Australia, aimed at enhancing rehabilitation services and quality of life for Aboriginal Australians following acquired brain injury. The trial translation plan was aspirational and action-oriented, with its implementation iterative and ongoing. Translational activities aimed to inform service and research planning for Aboriginal people with brain injury. Situated in the intercultural space, the work guards against undertaking activities that are monocultural, colonial and appropriating in favour of work that is authentically viewed through the dual lens of whiteness and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ways of knowing, being and doing, and is strengths-based. Methods. Three translational and knowledge exchange components were identified, relating to the role of Aboriginal Brain Injury Coordinators, cultural training of hospital staff and the research process itself. Knowledge plans were developed for key audiences, with potential translation products to be monitored for ongoing impact. Results. Results demonstrate that translational and knowledge exchange were iteratively embedded throughout the trial life cycle. Data sources included community engagement, partnership meetings and interviews. Activities involved presentations to diverse audiences including bureaucrats, community and participants. Conclusions. This report provides a snapshot of the first translation knowledge exchange plan and activities constructed in relation to brain injury rehabilitation services for Aboriginal people. Challenges encountered, as well as successes to date, are discussed. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2024 The Author(s)",10.1071/IB23109,Health,,,,Field experiment,A step-wedge design,The sample size is not given.,"The provided description does not specify whether the study showed statistically significant results or detail the specific outcomes.

Karpouzis F.; Lindberg R.; Walsh A.; Shah S.; Abbott G.; Ball K.,Impact and process evaluation of a primary-school Food Education and Sustainability Training (FEAST) program in 10-12-year-old children in Australia: pragmatic cluster non-randomized controlled trial,2024,"Background: Environmentally sustainable food initiatives accompanying nutrition education, such as the Food Education and Sustainability Training (FEAST) program, have gained traction in school settings. The aim of this trial was to conduct an impact and process evaluation of FEAST, to evaluate its effect on children√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s fruit and vegetable (F&V) intakes, and secondary outcomes: F&V variety consumed, nutrition knowledge, food preparation/cooking skills, self-efficacy and behaviours, food waste knowledge and behaviours, and food production knowledge. Methods: FEAST was a 10-week curriculum-aligned program, designed to educate children about healthy eating, food waste, and sustainability, while teaching cooking skills. It was implemented by classroom teachers, face-to-face and online, during COVID-19 school closures, in Australia in 2021. A custom designed survey was used to collect baseline and post-intervention data from students. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) estimated group differences in pre-post changes for primary and secondary outcomes. Surveys were also administered to students and teachers to evaluate intervention implementation. Results: Twenty schools participated and self-selected to be either intervention schools (n = 10) or wait-list control (WLC) schools (n = 10). A total of 977, 5th and 6th grade children participated in the trial with a mean age of 11.1 years (SD √É‚Äö√Ç¬± 0.7). The FEAST intervention, compared to WLC, did not result in significant increases in primary outcomes nor secondary outcomes. The process evaluation revealed FEAST was well-received by students and teachers, but COVID-19 school closures hindered implementation fidelity with a less intense program delivered under the constraints of pandemic lockdowns. Conclusions: This is the first cluster non-randomized controlled trial designed to independently evaluate FEAST in the primary-school setting. No evidence was found for improved F&V intakes in children, nor secondary outcomes. However, the positive process evaluation results suggest that further trials of the program are warranted. If implemented as originally designed (pre-pandemic), with increased duration and complemented by supporting school policies, such programs have the potential to improve children√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s daily F&V intakes, cooking skills and food waste behaviours. This would support the Australian curriculum and contribute to: health promotion within schools and sustainable schools initiatives, the national agenda to reduce food waste and sustainable development goals.

Delaney T.; Jackson J.; Lecathelinais C.; Clinton-McHarg T.; Lamont H.; Yoong S.L.; Wolfenden L.; Sutherland R.; Wyse R.,Long-Term Effectiveness of a Multi-Strategy Choice Architecture Intervention in Increasing Healthy Food Choices of High-School Students From Online Canteens (Click & Crunch High Schools): Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,2024,"Background: School canteens are a recommended setting to influence adolescent nutrition due to their scope to improve student food choices. Online lunch ordering systems (√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúonline canteens√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù) are increasingly used and represent attractive infrastructure to implement choice architecture interventions that nudge users toward healthier food choices. A recent cluster randomized controlled trial demonstrated the short-term effectiveness (2-month follow-up) of a choice architecture intervention to increase the healthiness of foods purchased by high school students from online canteens. However, there is little evidence regarding the long-term effectiveness of choice architecture interventions targeting adolescent food purchases, particularly those delivered online. Objective: This study aimed to determine the long-term effectiveness of a multi-strategy choice architecture intervention embedded within online canteen infrastructure in high schools at a 15-month follow-up. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was undertaken with 1331 students (from 9 high schools) in New South Wales, Australia. Schools were randomized to receive the automated choice architecture intervention (including menu labeling, positioning, feedback, and prompting strategies) or the control (standard online ordering). The foods purchased were classified according to the New South Wales Healthy Canteen strategy as either √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúeveryday,√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúoccasional,√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù or √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúshould not be sold.√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù Primary outcomes were the average proportion of √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúeveryday,√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúoccasional,√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù and √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúshould not be sold√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù items purchased per student. Secondary outcomes were the mean energy, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium content of purchases. Outcomes were assessed using routine data collected by the online canteen. Results: From baseline to 15-month follow-up, on average, students in the intervention group ordered significantly more √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúeveryday√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù items (+11.5%, 95% CI 7.3% to 15.6%; P<.001), and significantly fewer √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúoccasional√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù (√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì5.4%, 95% CI √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì9.4% to √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì1.5%; P=.007) and √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúshould not be sold√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù items (√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì6%, 95% CI √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì9.1% to √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì2.9%; P<.001), relative to controls. There were no between-group differences over time in the mean energy, saturated fat, sugar, or sodium content of lunch orders. Conclusions: Given their longer-term effectiveness, choice architecture interventions delivered via online canteens may represent a promising option for policy makers to support healthy eating among high school students. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

However, a large proportion of ECEC services do not have nor implement a physical activity policy. Play Active is an evidence-informed physical activity policy intervention with implementation support strategies to enable ECEC services to successfully implement their policy. This study examined the effectiveness, implementation, and process outcomes of Play Active. Methods: A pragmatic cluster randomised trial in 81 ECEC services in Perth, Western Australia was conducted in 2021. Services implemented their physical activity policy over a minimum of three months. The effectiveness outcomes were changes in educator practices related to daily time provided for total physical activity and energetic play. Implementation outcomes included changes in director- and educator-reported uptake of policy practices and director-reported uptake of high impact and low effort policy practices. Process evaluation outcomes included awareness, fidelity, reach, and acceptability of the intervention and implementation strategies. Analysis involved descriptive statistics and generalised linear mixed effects models. Results: There was a significant increase in the uptake of director-reported policy practices (p = 0.034), but no change in the uptake of the subset of high impact and low effort policy practices. Intervention group educators reported high awareness of the Play Active policy recommendations (90%). Play Active acceptability was high among educators (83%) and directors (78%). Fidelity and reach were high for most implementation support strategies (> 75%). There were no significant changes in the amount of physical activity or energetic play educators provided to children or in the proportion of educators providing the policy recommended √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬• 180√É‚Äö√Ç¬†min of physical activity/day or √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬• 30√É‚Äö√Ç¬†min of energetic play/day for intervention compared to wait-listed comparison services. Conclusions: Play Active resulted in significantly higher uptake of physical activity practices. However, there was no change in the amount of physical activity provided to children, which may be explained by the relatively short policy implementation period. Importantly, Play Active had high awareness, fidelity, reach, and acceptability. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of Play Active over longer implementation periods and its scalability potential.

Ju X.; Mittinty M.N.; Smithers L.; Jamieson L.,Early Childhood Caries Intervention in Aboriginal Australian Children: A Cross-in Randomized Trial,2024,"Introduction: Early childhood caries (ECC) is the strongest predictor of dental caries in adulthood. Indigenous children have higher levels of ECC compared with non-Indigenous children. The study aimed to estimate the efficacy of an ECC intervention among Aboriginal Australian children. Methods: Baby Teeth Talk was an outcome assessor-blinded, closed-cohort cross-in randomized controlled trial conducted in South Australia, Australia. We randomly allocated 448 women pregnant with an Aboriginal child to either an immediate (II) or delayed (DI) intervention group between January 2011 and May 2012. The immediate intervention comprised (1) provision of dental care to mothers during pregnancy; (2) application of fluoride varnish to teeth of children at ages 6, 12; and 18 mo; (3) motivational interviewing delivered in conjunction; and (4) anticipatory guidance. Mothers/children in the DI group received the same intervention commencing when the child was 24 mo of age. The outcomes were assessed by the number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth (dmft) in children aged 24, 36, and 60 mo. Regression-based approaches with generalized linear mixed effect (log-Poisson) model characterized the mean dmft to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: A total of 223 participants were randomly allocated to the II group and 225 to the DI group. Three hundred sixty-five children (178 II, 187 DI) received at least 1 dental clinical examination at 24, 36, and 60 mo of follow-up. The mean dmft was lower in the II group (0.48, 1.32, and 2.06) than in the DI group (0.82, 1.90, and 3.29) at each time point, respectively. The direct ECC intervention effect was to prevent/decrease dental decay experience (dmft) occurrence by 84% (RR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.20√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì2.48) after adjusting for all covariates. Conclusions: Our analysis indicated that the time-varied ECC intervention had immediate and longer-term effects on the prevention of ECC among Indigenous Australian children. Knowledge Transfer Statement: The study aimed to estimate the efficacy of an early childhood caries (ECC) intervention among Aboriginal Australian children. The findings indicated that the culturally appropriate ECC intervention is effective for the preventive of ECC and can be used by clinicians, educators, and policy makers when planning an ECC intervention, so as to prevent and reduce ECC and meet identified oral health needs across the Australian population, which is important for preventive dental care. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© The Author(s) 2023.",10.1177/23800844231191714,Health,,,,Field experiment,A cross-in randomized controlled trial,448,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

This paper aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of a multi-arm primary school-based intervention to increase physical activity and/or reduce sedentary time in 8√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì9 year old children (Transform-Us!). Methods: Modelled cost-utility analysis, using costs and effects from a cluster randomized controlled trial of a 30-month intervention that used pedagogical and environmental strategies to reduce and break up sedentary behaviour (SB-I), promote physical activity (PA-I), or a combined approach (PA + SB-I), compared to current practice. A validated multiple-cohort lifetable model (ACE-Obesity Policy model) estimated the obesity and physical activity-related health outcomes (measured as change in body mass index and change in metabolic equivalent task minutes respectively) and healthcare cost-savings over the cohort√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s lifetime from the public-payer perspective, assuming the intervention was delivered to all 8√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì9 year old children attending Australian Government primary schools. Sensitivity analyses tested the impact on cost-effectiveness of varying key input parameters, including maintenance of intervention effect assumptions. Results: Cost-effectiveness results demonstrated that, when compared to control schools, the PA-I and SB-I intervention arms were √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúdominant√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù, meaning that they resulted in net health benefits and healthcare cost-savings if the intervention effects were maintained. When the costs and effects of these intervention arms were extrapolated to the Australian population, results suggested significant potential as obesity prevention measures (PA-I: 60,780 HALYs saved (95% UI 15,007-109,413), healthcare cost-savings AUD641M (95% UI AUD165M-1.1B); SB-I: 61,126 HALYs saved (95% UI 11,770 √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 111,249), healthcare cost-savings AUD654M (95% UI AUD126M-1.2B)). The PA-I and SB-I interventions remained cost-effective in sensitivity analysis, assuming the full decay of intervention effect after 10 years. Conclusions: The PA-I and SB-I Transform-Us! intervention arms represent good value for money and could lead to health benefits and healthcare cost-savings arising from the prevention of chronic disease in later life if intervention effects are sustained.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies are highly effective and have few side effects compared to older interferon-based therapy. Despite the Australian government providing subsidised and unrestricted access to DAA therapy for chronic HCV infection, uptake has not been sufficient to meet the global target of eliminating HCV as a public health threat by 2030. This study will offer people with HCV financial incentives of varying values in order to evaluate its effect on initiation of DAA therapy in primary care. Methods: Australian adults (18√É‚Äö√Ç¬†years or older) who self-report as having current untreated HCV infection can register to participate via an automated SMS-based system. Following self-screening for eligibility, registrants are offered a financial incentive of randomised value (AUD 0 to 1000) to initiate DAA therapy. Study treatment navigators contact registrants who have consented to be contacted, to complete eligibility assessment, outline the study procedures (including the requirement for participants to consult a primary care provider), obtain consent, and finalise enrolment. Enrolled participants receive their offered incentive on provision of evidence of DAA therapy initiation within 12√É‚Äö√Ç¬†weeks of registration (primary endpoint). Balanced randomisation is used across the incentive range until the first analysis, after which response-adaptive randomisation will be used to update the assignment probabilities. For the primary analysis, a Bayesian 4-parameter EMAX model will be used to estimate the dose√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ìresponse curve and contrast treatment initiation at each incentive value against the control arm (AUD 0). Specified secondary statistical and economic analyses will evaluate the effect of incentives on adherence to DAA therapy, virological response, and cost-effectiveness. Discussion: This project seeks to gain an understanding of the dose√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ìresponse relationship between incentive value and DAA treatment initiation, while maximising the number of people treated for HCV within fixed budget and time constraints. In doing so, we hope to offer policy-relevant recommendation(s) for the use of financial incentives as a pragmatic, efficient, and cost-effective approach to achieving elimination of HCV from Australia.

Nguyen H.N.J.; Mensah F.; Goldfeld S.; Mainzer R.; Price A.,The complementary impacts of nurse home visiting and quality childcare for children experiencing adversity,2024,"Australian Governments are increasingly understanding the impacts of early adversity, evidenced by ongoing policy and investment in two of the most widely implemented early interventions: nurse home visiting (NHV) and early childhood education and care (ECEC). Neither intervention fully redresses the developmental inequities engendered by early adversity, yet their synergistic impacts (√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúdynamic complementarity√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù) are unknown. In this research, we aimed to (1) inform evaluation of policy implementation by (2) experimentally testing the dynamic complementarity of NHV and ECEC. We capitalised on an opportunity afforded by the Australian √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúright@home√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù randomised trial, which involved 722 pregnant women experiencing adversity, randomised to receive NHV or usual care to child age 2 years. Detailed data describing family-accessed ECEC were collected from parents at 3√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì4 years, and √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúquality ECEC√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù was categorised according to meeting quality recommendations defined by Australian policy and provision. Children's developmental outcomes (language, executive functioning, behaviour and well-being) were parent-reported or assessed directly at 4 years. At 4 years, 33 per cent of families had received neither intervention; 40 per cent NHV only; 14 per cent quality ECEC only; and 13 per cent had received both. We used linear regression to estimate differences in mean outcomes between exposure groups, including interaction between NHV and ECEC. Unadjusted analyses indicated modest effects of the combination of NHV and ECEC, which attenuated after adjustment for socioeconomic confounders. We present the design and preliminary findings as an approach that could be used to evaluate equitable implementation at scale and enable policymakers to determine the most effective evidence-based policy. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2024 The Authors.

The intervention involved a boosted workforce of > 170 local-level staff in 12 communities; employed to deliver system activation around health and wellbeing for individuals, families and communities. A cluster randomised trial (CRT) of a systems thinking approach to obesity prevention was embedded within HTV. We present the two-year changes in overweight and obesity and associated behaviours among secondary school students across Victoria, Australia. Methods: Twenty-three geographically bounded areas were randomised to intervention (12 communities) or comparison (11 communities). Randomly selected secondary schools within each community were invited to participate in the trial in 2014 and 2016. Students in Grade 8 (aged approximately 13√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì15 years) and Grade 10 (aged approximately 15√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì16 years) at participating schools were recruited using an opt-out approach across July√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSeptember 2014 and 2016. Primary outcomes were body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Secondary outcomes were physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet quality, health-related quality of life, and depressive symptoms. Linear mixed models were fit to estimate the intervention effect adjusting for child/school characteristics. Results: There were 4242 intervention children and 2999 control children in the final analysis. For boys, the two-year change showed improvement in intervention versus control for waist circumference (difference in change: √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 2.5 cm; 95% confidence interval [CI]: √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 4.6, √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 0.5) and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages per day (< 1 serve: 8.5 percentage points; 95% CI: 0.6, 16.5). For girls, there were no statistically significant differences between conditions. Conclusions: HTV seemed to produce favourable changes in waist circumference and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption for boys, however, no effect on BMI was observed. Although the HTV intervention was cut short, and the period between data collection points was relatively short, the changes observed in HTV contribute to the growing evidence of whole-of-community interventions targeting childhood obesity. Trial registration: This trial is unregistered. The intervention itself was a policy setting delivered by government and our role was the collection of data to evaluate the effect of this natural experiment. That is, this study was not a trial from the classical point of view and we were not responsible for the intervention. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© The Author(s) 2024.",10.1186/s12889-024-17906-2,Nutrition and exercise,,,,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,7241,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Improving routine cleaning and disinfection of the hospital environment has been shown to reduce the risk of HAI. Contaminated shared medical equipment presents a primary transmission route for infectious pathogens, yet is rarely studied. The CLEEN study will assess how enhanced cleaning and disinfection of shared medical equipment affects the rate of HAIs in a tertiary hospital setting. The initiative is an evidence-based approach combining staff training, auditing and feedback to environmental services staff to enhance cleaning and disinfection practices. Methods: The CLEEN study will use a stepped wedge randomised controlled design in 10 wards of one large Australian hospital over 36√É‚Äö√Ç¬†weeks. The intervention will consist of 3 additional hours per weekday for the dedicated cleaning and disinfection of shared medical equipment on each ward. The primary outcome is to demonstrate the effectiveness of improving the quality and frequency of cleaning shared medical equipment in reducing HAIs, as measured by a HAI point prevalence study (PPS). The secondary outcomes include the thoroughness of equipment cleaning assessed using fluorescent marker technology and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Discussion: Evidence from the CLEEN study will contribute to future policy and practice guidelines about the cleaning and disinfection of shared medical equipment. It will be used by healthcare leaders and clinicians to inform decision-making and implementation of best-practice infection prevention strategies to reduce HAIs in healthcare facilities.

However, little is known about their long-run outcomes or the consequences of ending such services. We investigate both aspects by examining the long-run effects of an intensive support program on the housing, employment, and health outcomes of chronically homeless people in Australia. Evaluating the three-year program over six-years using a randomised controlled trial, we document substantially higher rates of housing and better employment outcomes during the program period for the treated group, but no substantial changes in health. Three years after the program ends, we observe no significant differences between the treatment and control group with respect to any outcomes, including housing. Our results imply that stable housing is a necessary but not sufficient condition to overcome multiple sources of economic and social disadvantage. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2022",10.1016/j.jue.2022.103511,Social services,,,,Field experiment,A regular RCT,_,"The study showed statistically significant results during the program period, with the treated group experiencing substantially higher rates of housing and better employment outcomes.

Objectives: To assess the psychosocial and health services use effects of notifying women participating in population-based breast cancer screening that they have dense breasts; to examine whether the mode of communicating this information about its implications (print, online formats) influences these effects. Methods and analysis: The study population comprises women aged 40 years or older who attend BreastScreen Queensland Sunshine Coast services for mammographic screening and are found to have dense breasts (BI-RADS density C or D). The randomised controlled trial includes three arms (952 women each): standard BreastScreen care (no notification of breast density; control arm); notification of dense breasts in screening results letter and print health literacy-sensitive information (intervention arm 1) or a link or QR code to online video-based health literacy-sensitive information (intervention arm 2). Baseline demographic data will be obtained from BreastScreen Queensland. Outcomes data will be collected in questionnaires at baseline and eight weeks, twelve months, and 27 months after breast screening. Primary outcomes will be psychological outcomes and health service use; secondary outcomes will be supplemental screening outcomes, cancer worry, perceived breast cancer risk, knowledge about breast density, future mammographic screening intentions, and acceptability of notification about dense breasts.

However, access to mental health services is often limited by the availability of trained clinicians. Although building local community capability for the mental health response is often prioritised in policy settings, the lack of evidence-based programs is problematic. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of the Skills for Life Adjustment and Resilience programme (SOLAR) delivered by trained local community members following compound disasters (drought, wildfires, pandemic-related lockdowns) in Australia. Method: Thirty-six community members were trained to deliver the SOLAR programme, a skills-based, trauma informed, psychosocial programme. Sixty-six people with anxiety, depression and/or posttraumatic stress symptoms, and impairment were randomised into the SOLAR programme or a Self-Help condition. They were assessed pre, post and two months following the interventions. The SOLAR programme was delivered across five 1-hourly sessions (either face to face or virtually). Those in the Self-Help condition received weekly emails with self-help information including links to online educational videos. Results: Multigroup analyses indicated that participants in the SOLAR condition experienced significantly lower levels of anxiety and depression, and PTSD symptom severity between pre√É‚Äö√Ç¬†√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì and post-intervention (T1 to T2), relative to the Self-Help condition, while controlling for scores at intake. These differences were not statistically different at follow-up. The SOLAR programme was associated with large effect size improvements in posttraumatic stress symptoms over time. Conclusion: The SOLAR programme was effective in improving anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms over time. However, by follow-up the size of the effect was similar to an active self-help condition. Given the ongoing stressors in the community associated with compounding disasters it may be that booster sessions would have been useful to sustain programme impact.

Farnbach S.; Henderson A.; Allan J.; Wallace R.; Shakeshaft A.,A Cluster-Randomised Stepped-Wedge Impact Evaluation of a Pragmatic Implementation Process for Improving the Cultural Responsiveness of Non-Aboriginal Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Services: A Pilot Study,2023,"There is limited evidence regarding implementing organisational improvements in the cultural responsiveness of non-Aboriginal services. Using a pragmatic implementation process to promote organisational change around cultural responsiveness, we aimed to (i) identify its impact on the cultural responsiveness of participating services; (ii) identify areas with the most improvement; and (iii) present a program logic to guide cultural responsiveness. A best-evidence guideline for culturally responsive service delivery in non-Aboriginal Alcohol and other Drug (AoD) treatment services was co-designed. Services were grouped geographically and randomised to start dates using a stepped wedge design, then baseline audits were completed (operationalization of the guideline). After receiving feedback, the services attended guideline implementation workshops and selected three key action areas; they then completed follow-up audits. A two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhitney) test was used to analyse differences between baseline and follow-up audits on three key action areas and all other action areas. Improvements occurred across guideline themes, with significant increases between median baseline and follow-up audit scores on three key action areas (median increase = 2.0; Interquartile Range (IQR) = 1.0√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì3.0) and all other action areas (median increase = 7.5; IQR = 5.0√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì11.0).

Jovelijic J.; Shinners L.R.; Coutts R.A.,An evaluation of the use of an iPad for hospital orientation in a regional hospital,2023,"Problem: Patient orientation is a crucial point of information exchange, designed to support and enhance patient safety, comfort, and understanding during their hospital stay. Currently, most hospital patients receive face-to-face orientation with a nurse. The quality and content of orientation information can be affected by the nurse's emotional state, job satisfaction, knowledge, and authenticity for the information conveyed, which can have a positive or negative impact on the patient. Aim: Focusing on key hospital policies and protocols, in a regional New South Wales hospital and compared to routine ward orientation, the objective was to assess the efficacy of digital video orientation. Methods: A two-group design was conducted utilising quantitative and qualitative approaches and drew on self-report, focusing on overall Understanding and Emotional Comfort. Participants (n = 35) were selected and randomly allocated into a digital orientation or face-to-face orientation group. Findings: Emotional Comfort scores for both groups were found to be similar (p < 0.05 level, t(33) = 0.27, p = 0.09), while the digital orientation group was found to have significantly higher understanding of key hospital policy (t(33) = √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢3.98, p < 0.001). Additionally, there was a negative correlation (r = √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢0.45, p = 0.006) between age and self-reported understanding, revealing that the lower age groups had scored higher. Discussion: This research has demonstrated that key concepts can be effectively communicated using a digital format.

Design: Single-site, double-blinded randomised controlled trial. Setting: Maroondah BreastScreen (Eastern Health, Melbourne), part of the national breast cancer screening program. Participants: Women aged 40 years or more, with or without a history of breast cancer and reporting any alcohol consumption, who attended the clinic for routine mammography during 5√É‚Äö√Ç¬†February √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì 27 August 2021. Intervention: Active arm: animation including brief alcohol intervention (four minutes) and lifestyle health promotion (three minutes). Control arm: lifestyle health promotion only. Major outcome measure: Change in proportion of women who identified alcohol use as a clear risk factor for breast cancer (scaled response measure). Results: The mean age of the 557 participants was 60.3 years (standard deviation, 7.7 years; range, 40√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì87 years); 455 had recently consumed alcohol (82%). The proportions of participants aware that alcohol use increased the risk of breast cancer were larger at four weeks than at baseline for both the active intervention (65% v 20%; odds ratio [OR], 41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 18√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì97) and control arms of the study (38% v 20%; OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.8√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì8.8), but the change over time was greater for the active intervention arm (arm √É∆í√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù time: P < 0.001). Alcohol literacy also increased to a greater extent in the active than the control arm, but alcohol consumption did not significantly change in either arm. Conclusion: A tailored brief alcohol intervention for women attending breast screening was effective for improving awareness of the increased breast cancer risk associated with alcohol use and alcohol literacy more broadly. Such interventions are particularly important given the rising prevalence of risky drinking among middle-aged and older women and evidence that even very light alcohol consumption increases breast cancer risk.

The rapid uptake of online lunch ordering within school canteens provides a unique opportunity to implement choice architecture strategies that support healthier food choices with high fidelity. Despite this, no trial has tested the efficacy of choice architecture strategies within an online lunch ordering system on improving the nutritional quality of high school student lunch purchases. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of embedding choice architecture strategies into an online lunch ordering system on the nutritional quality of the school canteen lunch purchases of high school students (aged 12√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì19 years). Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with nine high schools in one Australian state. Schools were randomized to receive either a 2-month choice architecture intervention (involving menu labelling, prompts, item positioning, and feedback), or usual online ordering. Nutrient quality of online canteen lunch purchases was assessed using routine data collected by the online ordering system. Primary outcomes were the proportion of √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√ã≈ìEveryday√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢, √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√ã≈ìOccasional√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢, and √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√ã≈ìShould not be sold√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ items purchased, categorized using the state healthy canteen policy. Secondary outcomes were the mean energy, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium content of purchases and the mean weekly revenue from online lunch orders. Linear mixed models were analyzed to assess outcomes. Results: Analysis of the student cohort (Intervention: 4 schools, 656 students; Control: 5 schools, 675 students) showed significant between group differences over time for the intervention group for the mean percentage of online lunch items per student that were √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√ã≈ìEveryday√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ (+ 5.5%; P < 0.001) and √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√ã≈ìShould not be sold√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ (√É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 4.4%; P < 0.001). There were no between group differences over time in the mean percentage of online lunch items that were √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√ã≈ìOccasional√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢; the average energy, saturated fat, sugar, or sodium content of lunch orders. There was also no difference in mean weekly revenue from high school student online lunch orders (P = 0.23). Conclusions: These findings suggest that a low intensity, choice architecture intervention embedded within an online ordering system can increase the purchase of healthier food items for high school students in one Australian state without any adverse impact on canteen revenue.

Denison E.; Faulkner N.; O'Brien K.S.; Jeanes R.; Canning M.,Effectiveness of an educational intervention targeting homophobic language use by young male athletes: a cluster randomised controlled trial,2023,"Objective Homophobic language is common in male sport and associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for all sport participants, but particularly for gay or bisexual youth populations. Evidence-based interventions are needed to reduce such language and mitigate harm. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a short social-cognitive educational intervention delivered by professional rugby union players in youth sport. Methods In a two-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial, 13 Australian youth rugby teams from 9 clubs (N=167, ages 16-20, mean 17.9) were randomised into intervention or control groups. Professional rugby players delivered the intervention in-person. Frequency of homophobic language use was measured 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the intervention. Hypothesised factors underpinning homophobic language were also measured, including descriptive (other people use), prescriptive and proscriptive injunctive norms (approval/disapproval by others), and attitudes towards the acceptability of homophobic language. Results At baseline, 49.1% of participants self-reported using homophobic language in the past 2 weeks and 72.7% reported teammates using homophobic language. Significant relationships were found between this behaviour and the hypothesised factors targeted by the intervention. However, generalised estimating equations found the intervention did not significantly reduce homophobic language, or alter the associated norms and attitudes, relative to controls. Conclusion Use of professional rugby athletes to deliver education on homophobic language was not effective. Other approaches to reduce homophobic language (and other forms of discrimination) such as peer-to-peer education, and enforcement of policies prohibiting specific language by coaches, should be explored.  √É‚Äö√Ç¬© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2023.

A cluster randomised controlled trial,2022,"Background: About 44% of Indigenous Australian women smoke during pregnancy, compared with 12% of pregnant non-Indigenous women. Health care providers can assist smoking cessation, but they are not typically trained in culturally appropriate methods. Objectives: To determine whether a health care worker training intervention increases smoking cessation rates among Indigenous pregnant smokers compared with usual care. Methods and analysis: Supporting Indigenous Smokers to Assist Quitting (SISTAQUIT) study is a multicentre, hybrid type 1, pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial that compares the effects of an intervention for improving smoking cessation by pregnant Indigenous women (16 years or older, 32 weeks√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ gestation or less) with usual care. Twenty-one health services caring for Indigenous people in five Australian jurisdictions were randomised to the intervention (ten sites) or control groups (eleven sites). Health care providers at intervention sites received smoking cessation care training based on the ABCD (ask/assess; brief advice; cessation; discuss psychosocial context) approach to smoking cessation for Indigenous women, an educational resource package, free oral nicotine replacement therapy for participating women, implementation support, and trial implementation training. Health care providers in control group services provided usual care. Primary outcome: abstinence from smoking (self-reported abstinence via survey, validated by carbon monoxide breath testing when possible) four weeks after enrolment in the study. Secondary outcomes: health service process evaluations; knowledge, attitudes, and practices of health care providers; and longer term abstinence, perinatal outcomes, and respiratory outcomes for babies (to six months). Ethics approval: The human research ethics committees of the University of Newcastle (H-2015-0438) and the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW (1140/15) provided the primary ethics approval.

Me P.; Mj E.; Ad O.; Patterson K.; Batterham M.; Ra J.,A blended professional learning intervention for early childhood educators to target the promotion of physical activity and healthy eating: the HOPPEL cluster randomized stepped-wedge trial,2022,"Background: Childcare centres are important environments for promoting physical activity and healthy eating. Blended approaches to professional learning may help overcome existing challenges for educators in promoting these behaviours. This study aimed to test the effect of a blended professional learning program on healthy eating and physical activity in childcare. Methods: Cluster randomized stepped-wedge trial in 15 childcare centres in Tasmania, Australia. Children aged 2-5y who attended at least two days per week were eligible to participate. Random assignment occurred at the centre level. Centre names were drawn out of a hat and then subsequently allocated to one of the three steps. The intervention comprised a 12-week blended professional learning program for educators. The main outcome was centre-level physical activity and healthy eating, assessed using the Environment and Policy Assessment Observation System (EPAO). All data collectors were blinded to step allocation. Analyses were according to intention to treat. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12618000346279, date registered: 07/03/2018). Results: Centres were recruited between January 2016 and February 2016. All centres were retained for the duration of the study. A total of 313 children were recruited with 291 analysed at the completion of the study (93%). The difference between groups for the EPAO total score was significant at the end of the maintenance period (adjusted difference = 14.63, 95% CI [1.33, 27.92], p = 0.03). Significant differences were found for the percentage of time children spent in light-intensity physical activity at the end of the intervention (adjusted difference = 0.01, 95% CI [0.00,0.01], p = 0.02) and maintenance periods (adjusted difference = 0.01, 95% CI [0.00,0.02], p = 0.04). To the best of the authors knowledge, there were no adverse events. Conclusion: This intervention achieved a sustained improvement in physical activity and healthy eating in childcare centres. Further, it can be easily integrated into existing service provision, especially among centres with limited access to professional learning.

Methods: A 2x2 factorial group cluster-randomised controlled trial was undertaken in 12 Australian primary schools. The nine-month intervention supported classroom teachers to increase scheduled weekly PA for their class via physical education, sport, Energisers and integrated lessons. Teachers√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ PA (n√É‚Äö√Ç¬†=√É‚Äö√Ç¬†76) was measured at follow-up only using accelerometers (Actigraph GT3X or GT9X). Linear mixed models were used to estimate between-group differences in teachers√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ mean minutes of sedentary, light, moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) across the school day and during class-time. Results: At follow-up, there were non-significant between-group differences favouring intervention teachers, compared to controls, for light PA (4.9√É‚Äö√Ç¬†minutes, 95% CI: √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢6.3, 16.0; P√É‚Äö√Ç¬†=.33) and MVPA (0.4√É‚Äö√Ç¬†minutes, 95% CI: √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢10.9, 11.6; P√É‚Äö√Ç¬†=.94) across the school day; although not favouring the intervention for sedentary behaviour (5.1√É‚Äö√Ç¬†minutes, 95% CI: √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢11.4, 21.7; P√É‚Äö√Ç¬†=.48).

Riesenberg D.; Peeters A.; Backholer K.; Martin J.; Mhurchu C.N.; Blake M.R.,Exploring the effects of added sugar labels on food purchasing behaviour in Australian parents: An online randomised controlled trial,2022,"Background Evidence of the effects of front-of-pack added sugar labelling remains limited, especially for foods other than sugary drinks. More information is needed about which labels are likely to be most effective in reducing intended purchases of products with higher added sugar content in realistic contexts to inform policymakers' decisions. Objective To determine the impact of added sugar labels on intended purchases of high sugar breakfast cereals, yoghurt, and non-alcoholic beverages. Methods Australian parents who were regular purchasers of relevant product categories completed an online parallel randomised controlled trial from 31 August 2020 to 13 February 2021. Participants selected their intended purchase from 10 products in each of packaged beverages, breakfast cereal, and yoghurt categories after randomisation to one of seven added sugar labelling conditions in current use or under consideration by the Australian Government. Logistic regressions assessed differences between intervention and control conditions in the odds of intended purchases of a high sugar product. Results 2825 eligible participants were randomised with 2582 valid surveys analysed (Control n = 367; 'Nutrition Information Panel (NIP) with Added Sugar' n = 364; 'Teaspoons of Sugar' n = 369; 'Warning' n = 371; 'Health Star Rating (HSR) using Total Sugar' n = 368; 'HSR with Added Sugar' n = 371; 'Sugar in the Ingredients List' n = 372). No consistent effects were found on intended purchases of high sugar products overall or within product categories for any of the tested labels compared to controls (overall, 'NIP with Added Sugar': OR 1.00 [95%CI 0.83,1.20]; 'Teaspoons of Sugar': 0.94[0.80,1.11]; 'Warning': 1.10[0.93,1.30]; 'HSR with Total Sugar': 1.01[0.85,1.21]; 'HSR with Added Sugar': 1.09[0.92,1.30]; 'Sugar in the Ingredients List': 1.01[0.85,1.21]).

Objective: To assess the effect of mammographic breast density notification and information provision on women's intention to seek supplemental screening and psychological outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A 3-arm online randomized clinical trial was conducted from August 10 to 31, 2021. Data analysis was conducted from September 1 to October 20, 2021. Participants included Australian residents identifying as female, aged between 40 and 74 years, with no history of breast cancer who were residing in jurisdictions without existing breast density notification with screening mammograms. Interventions: Women were randomized to receive 1 of the following hypothetical breast screening test result letters: screening mammogram result letter without breast density messaging (control), screening mammogram result letter with breast density messaging and an existing density information letter taken from a screening service in Australia (intervention 1), and screening mammogram result letter with breast density messaging and a health literacy-sensitive version of the letter adapted for people with lower health literacy (intervention 2). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were intention to seek supplemental screening; feeling anxious (uneasy, worried, or nervous), informed, or confused; and having breast cancer worry. Results: A total of 1420 Australian women were randomized and included in the final analysis. The largest group consisted of 603 women aged 60 to 74 years (42.5%). Compared with the control cohort (n = 480), women who received density notification via intervention 1 (n = 470) and intervention 2 (n = 470) reported a significantly higher intention to seek supplemental screening (0.8% vs 15.6% and 14.2%; P <.001) and feeling anxious (14.2% vs 49.4% and 48.5%; P <.001), confusion (7.8% vs 24.0% and 23.6%; P <.001), and worry about breast cancer (quite/very worried: 6.9% vs 17.2% and 15.5%; P <.001). There were no statistically significant differences in these outcomes between the 2 intervention groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, breast density notification and information integrated with screening mammogram results increased women's intention to seek supplemental screening and made women feel anxious, confused, or worried about breast cancer. These findings have relevance and implications for mammogram screening services and policy makers considering whether and, if so, how best to implement widespread notification of breast density as part of mammography screening.

Hammersley M.L.; Hedges J.; Poirier B.F.; Jamieson L.M.; Smithers L.G.,Strategies to Support Sustained Participant Engagement in an Oral Health Promotion Study for Indigenous Children and Their Families in Australia,2022,"The health inequities of Indigenous peoples compared with non-Indigenous peoples are significant and long-standing across many countries. Colonisation and dispossession of land and culture has led to profound and devastating consequences on the health of Indigenous peoples. A lack of trust and cultural security of health services remains a barrier to participation in health care services. Similarly, engagement in research activities is also hindered by a history of unethical research practices. Creating partnerships between researchers and Indigenous communities is key in developing research studies that are culturally appropriate, acceptable and relevant to the needs of Indigenous peoples. Baby Teeth Talk was a randomised controlled trial conducted with Indigenous children and their mothers in South Australia that tested an intervention involving dental care, anticipatory guidance on oral health and dietary intake, and motivational interviewing. The study was developed in consultation and partnership with local Indigenous communities in South Australia and overseen by the study√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s Aboriginal reference group. The recruitment and retention of participants in the study has been strong over numerous waves of follow-up. The purpose of this paper is to describe the strategies employed in the study that contributed to the successful and sustained engagement of the participants. These strategies included the establishment of an Aboriginal reference group, building relationships with organisations and community, flexibility of appointment scheduling and allocating adequate time, reimbursement for participant time, developing rapport with participants, encouraging participant self-determination, and adaptation of dietary data collection to better suit participants. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2022 by the authors.

Objectives: To evaluate whether an intervention incorporating patient enrolment and a funding model for higher-risk patients influenced patient-reported experience measures, particularly relational continuity. Methods: Cluster-randomized controlled trial over 12 months (1 August 2018-31 July 2019). Participating patients within intervention practices were offered enrolment with a preferred general practitioner, a minimum of 3 longer appointments, and review within 7 days of hospital admission or emergency department attendance. Intervention practices received incentives for longer consultations (dependent on reducing unnecessary prescriptions and tests), early post-hospital follow-up, and hospitalization reductions. The primary outcome was patient-reported relational continuity, measured by the Primary Care Assessment Tool Short Form. Results: A total of 774 patients, aged 18-65 years with a chronic illness or aged over 65 years, from 34 general practices in metropolitan, regional, and rural Australia across 3 states participated. Response rates for questionnaires were >90%. From a maximum of 4.0, mean baseline scores for relational continuity were 3.38 (SE 0.05) and 3.42 (SE 0.05) in control and intervention arms, respectively, with no significant between-group differences in changes pre-post trial. There were no significant changes in other patient-focussed measures. Conclusion: Patient-reported relational continuity was high at baseline and not influenced by the intervention, signalling the need for caution with policies incorporating patient enrolment and financial incentives. Further research is required targeting at-risk patient groups with low baseline engagement with primary care. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2021 The Author(s).

Methods A cluster randomised controlled trial with 61 primary schools in New South Wales Australia. The 12-month multi-strategy intervention included; centralised technical assistance, ongoing consultation, principal's mandated change, identifying and preparing school champions, development of implementation plans, educational outreach visits and provision of educational materials. Control schools received usual support (guidelines for policy development via education department website and telephone support). Weekly minutes of structured PA implemented by classroom teachers (primary outcome) was measured via teacher completion of a daily log-book at baseline (October-December 2017), 12-month (October-December 2018) and 18-month (April-June 2019). Data were analysed using linear mixed effects regression models. Results Overall, 400 class teachers at baseline, 403 at 12 months follow-up and 391 at 18 months follow-up provided valid primary outcome data. From baseline to 12-month follow-up, teachers at intervention schools recorded a greater increase in weekly minutes of PA implemented than teachers assigned to the control schools by approximately 44.2 min (95% CI 32.8 to 55.7; p<0.001) which remained at 18 months, however, the effect size was smaller at 27.1 min (95% CI 15.5 to 38.6; p√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬§0.001). Conclusion A multi-strategy intervention increased mandatory PA policy implementation. Some, but not all of this improvement was maintained after implementation support concluded.

This paper describes the third in a sequence of trials that sought to optimise an effective strategy (PACE) to assist schools√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ implementation of a physical activity policy. Specifically, it aimed to determine the probability that a multi-strategy intervention adapted to reduce in-person contact (Adapted PACE) was √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúas good as√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù the original intervention (PACE) in increasing the weekly minutes of structured physical activity implemented by classroom teachers. Methods: A noninferiority cluster randomised controlled trial was undertaken with 48 primary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Schools were randomised to receive PACE or a model with adaptations made to the delivery modes (Adapted PACE). Teachers√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ scheduled minutes of weekly physical activity was assessed at baseline (Oct 2018-Feb 2019) and 12-month follow-up (Oct-Dec 2019). The noninferiority margin was set at √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 16.4 minutes based on previous data and decision panel consensus. A linear mixed model analysed within a Bayesian framework was used to explore noninferiority between the two PACE models. A cost minimisation analysis was conducted from the health service provider perspective, using the Australian dollar (AUD). Results: The posterior estimate for the between group difference at follow-up was √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 2.3 minutes (95% credible interval = √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 18.02, 14.45 minutes). There was an estimated 96% probability of Adapted PACE being considered noninferior (only 4% of the posterior samples crossed the noninferiority margin of √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 16.4 minutes). That is, the minutes of physical activity implemented by teachers at Adapted PACE schools was not meaningfully less than the minutes of physical activity implemented by teachers at PACE schools. The mean total cost was AUD$25,375 (95% uncertainty interval = $21,499, $29,106) for PACE and AUD$16,421 (95% uncertainty interval = $13,974, $19,656) for Adapted PACE; an estimated reduction of AUD$373 (95% uncertainty interval = $173, $560) per school. Conclusions: It is highly probable that Adapted PACE is noninferior to the original model. It is a cost-efficient alternative also likely to be a more suitable approach to supporting large scale implementation of school√É‚Äö√Ç¬†physical activity policies.

Design: A cluster-randomised controlled trial. Methods: Following baseline 61 eligible schools were randomised to a 12-month, implementation intervention to increase teacher scheduling of physical activity, or a waitlist control. Whole school-day and class-time physical activity of students from grades 2 and 3 (~ages 7 to 9) were measured via wrist-worn accelerometers and included: moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, light physical activity, sedentary behaviour and activity counts per minute. Children's health related quality of life (HRQoL) and out-of-school-hours physical activity was measured via parent-proxy surveys. Class level on-task behaviour was measured via teacher self-report surveys. Student and teacher obtained outcomes were measured at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Parent reported outcomes were measured at 12-month follow-up. Linear mixed models compared between group differences in outcomes. Differential effects by sex were explored for student and parent reported outcomes. Results: Data from 2485 students, 1220 parents and >500 teachers were analysed. There was no statistically significant between group differences in any of the outcomes, including accelerometer measured physical activity, out-of-school-hours physical activity, HRQoL, and on-task behaviour. A statistically significant differential effect by sex was found for sedentary behaviour across the whole school day (3.16 min, 95% CI: 0.19, 6.13; p = 0.028), with females illustrating a greater difference between groups than males. Conclusions: Only negligible effects on student physical activity were found. Additional strategies including improving the quality of teacher's delivery of physical activity may be required to enhance effects. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2021 Sports Medicine Australia",10.1016/j.jsams.2021.12.005,Nutrition and exercise,,,,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,2485,"The study did not show statistically significant results for any of the primary outcomes, including accelerometer-measured physical activity, out-of-school-hours physical activity,",,,,,Jul 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A cluster-randomised controlled trial,2485 students,"The study did not show statistically significant results in any of the main outcomes, including accelerometer measured physical activity, out-of-school-hours physical activity, HR",Education; Health
Picco L.; Sanfilippo P.; Xia T.; Lam T.; Nielsen S.,"How do patient, pharmacist and medication characteristics and prescription drug monitoring program alerts influence pharmacists' decisions to dispense opioids? A randomised controlled factorial experiment",2022,"Background: Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP) are electronic databases that track the prescribing and dispensing of high-risk medicines such as opioids. They have the ability to provide clinicians with alerts, which identify medication-related risks, and are used to help inform decisions to supply. This study aimed to determine to what extent patient, pharmacist, and medication related characteristics and PDMP alerts influence decisions to dispense opioids and take other action, using a randomised controlled factorial design. Methods: Pharmacists completed an online factorial experiment, comprising six randomly generated vignettes, describing a hypothetical pharmacy patient. Pharmacists ranked the likelihood of dispensing an opioid prescription and indicated other actions, if any, they would make. Mixed-effects linear and logistical models were used to examine the association between the vignette (patient, medication and alerts), and pharmacist characteristics and the likelihood to dispense and take other actions. Results: 241 pharmacists were included in the analysis (n = 1353 vignettes). The PDMP alert for high dose and multiple prescriber episodes were significant predicators of reduced likelihood to dispense, with a respective 2.73- and 4.1-unit decrease in likelihood to dispense (p < 0.001). Alerts had the strongest association with other actions such as contacting the prescriber, talking to the patient and recommending naloxone, though patient and medication characteristics including age, opioid dose, benzodiazepine use and co-morbidity were also associated with increased odds of engaging in some actions. Conclusion: PDMP alerts were the most significant predictor of reduced likelihood to dispense and were associated with the greatest odds of taking other actions. Well-established risk factors such as high dose and high-risk drug combinations, in the absence of PDMP alerts, were associated with some actions, though to a lesser degree than PDMP alerts. These findings have significant policy implications and suggest PDMP alerts are a greater driver of decisions to dispense opioids and take other actions, compared with other known clinical risk factors. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2022",10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103856,Health,,,,Survey experiment,A randomised controlled factorial experiment,241,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Pu D.; Bonnici R.; Shorr R.; Haines T.,Digital storytelling to facilitate consumer engagement in healthcare research,2022,"Issues addressed: Consumer engagement in healthcare research presents with challenges, one of which is ensuring that the consumers have comprehended the often complex concepts in scientific research. This study aimed to compare how well older adult consumers understood video-based versus written and verbal description approaches to provision of information. Methods: Twenty adults in the community aged 60√É‚Äö√Ç¬†years and older were recruited for this study; half were randomised to receive the information via a digital story, and the other half received the same information from a written brief. Both mediums were presented via video teleconferencing. An interviewer was present to ask questions and address queries. Results: Participants who viewed the digital story requested for clarifications less frequently compared to those who received the written brief. Difficulty in understanding the information rose with complexity, but providing concrete examples aided comprehension of the information. Conclusions: Complex concepts benefit from the provision of concrete examples to facilitate understanding. Video-based approaches to provision of information are acceptable forms of participant engagement in research and require less human resources to successfully convey key information and facilitate understanding of the information. Research procedures that employ large amounts of data collection and/or asynchronous methods should consider the use of video-based approaches, such as digital stories, to increase cost-effectiveness. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2021 Australian Health Promotion Association.",10.1002/hpja.565,Health,,,,Survey experiment,A regular RCT,20,The abstract does not explicitly mention whether the results were statistically significant.

We investigated whether facilitation could improve nurses' vital sign measurement, interpretation, treatment and escalation of care for deteriorating patients. Methods In a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial, we randomised 36 inpatient wards at four acute hospitals to receive standard clinical practice guideline (CPG) dissemination to ward staff (n=18) or facilitated implementation for 6 months following standard dissemination (n=18). Expert, hospital and ward facilitators tailored facilitation techniques to promote nurses' CPG adherence. Patient records were audited pre-intervention, 6 and 12 months post-intervention on randomly selected days. Escalation of care as per hospital policy was the primary outcome at 6 and 12 months after implementation. Patients, nurses and assessors were blinded to group assignment. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Results From 10 383 audits, improved escalation as per hospital policy was evident in the intervention group at 6 months (OR 1.47, 95% CI (1.06 to 2.04)) with a complete set of vital sign measurements sustained at 12 months (OR 1.22, 95% CI (1.02 to 1.47)). There were no significant differences in escalation of care as per hospital policy between study groups at 6 or 12 months post-intervention. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, a significant change from T0 in mean length of stay between groups at 12 months favoured the intervention group (-2.18 days, 95% CI (-3.53 to-0.82)). Conclusion Multi-level facilitation significantly improved escalation as per hospital policy at 6 months in the intervention group that was not sustained at 12 months. The intervention group had increased vital sign measurement by nurses, as well as shorter lengths of stay for patients at 12 months. Further research is required to understand the dose of facilitation required to impact clinical practice behaviours and patient outcomes.

The effectiveness of a web-based menu planning intervention to increase childcare service provision of healthy foods and decrease provision of discretionary foods in long day-care services in Australia was assessed in a randomised controlled trial. Here we consider the costs, consequences, cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the intervention using data collected within the trial. Methods: The prospective trial-based economic evaluation involved 54 childcare services across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Services were randomised to a 12-month intervention or usual care. The intervention involved access to a web-based menu planning and decision support tool and online resources. Effectiveness measures included mean number of food groups, overall menu and individual food group compliance with dietary guidelines, and mean servings of food groups at 12 months. Costs (reported in $AUD, 2017/18) were evaluated from both health sector and societal perspectives. The direct cost to support uptake of the intervention was calculated, as were costs to each childcare service. The incremental cost of the intervention was calculated as the net difference in the cost to undertake menu planning and review plus the direct cost of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) including uncertainty intervals were estimated for differences in costs and effects between intervention and control groups. A relative value index was calculated to determine overall value for money. Results: Over the 12 months of the trial, we calculated a difference in cost between usual practice and intervention groups of √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ $482 (95% UI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ $859, √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ $56). While the measured increase in menu and food group compliance within the trial did not reach statistical significance, there were significant improvements in mean servings of fruit and discretionary food, represented in the cost-consequence analysis. The calculated relative value index of 1.1 suggests that the intervention returns acceptable value for money for the outcomes generated. Conclusion: Compared to usual practice, web-based programmes may offer an efficient and sustainable alternative for childcare services to improve the provision of healthy foods to children in their care.

This study aimed to determine a) the effectiveness of an adapted implementation intervention to scale-up PA4E1 at 24-month follow-up, b) fidelity and reach, and c) the cost and cost-effectiveness of the implementation support intervention. Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial using a type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness design in 49 lower socio-economic secondary schools, randomised to a program (n = 24) or control group (n = 25). An adapted implementation intervention consisting of seven strategies was developed to support schools to implement PA4E1 over 24-months. The primary outcome was the proportion of schools implementing at least four of the 7 PA practices, assessed via computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) with Head Physical Education Teachers. Secondary outcomes included the mean number of PA practices implemented, fidelity and reach, cost and cost-effectiveness. Logistic regression models assessed program effects. Results: At baseline, no schools implemented four of the 7 PA practices. At 24-months, significantly more schools in the program group (16/23, 69.6%) implemented at least four of the 7 PA practices than the control group (0/25, 0%) (p < 0.001). At 24-months, program schools were implementing an average of 3.6 more practices than control schools (4.1 (1.7) vs. 0.5 (0.8), respectively) (P < 0.001). Fidelity and reach of the implementation intervention were high (> 75%). The total cost of the program was $415,112 AUD (2018) ($17,296 per school; $117.30 per student). Conclusions: The adapted implementation intervention provides policy makers and researchers with an effective and potentially cost-effective model for scaling-up the delivery of PA4E1 in secondary schools.

Methods: Design: Secondary analysis of the √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúright@home√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù randomized trial of NHV. Participants: 722 pregnant Australian, English-speaking women experiencing adversity recruited from antenatal clinics across 2 states. Intervention: 25 nurse home visits to 2 years; Control: universal well-child nursing service. Measures: Parents reported formal ECEC use (government approved and subsidized), comprising long or family day care (LDC), and reasons for use. ECEC quality was classified using the Australian government's national ratings. Eighty-three percent of parents provided data at 2 years (306 intervention/290 control); and 69% at 3 years (255 intervention/240 control). Analysis: Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted using adjusted regression models, addressing missing data using multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting. Results: There was no evidence of group differences in ECEC uptake or quality, although control families may have used more LDC at 3 years (mean difference 2.8 hours, 95% confidence interval, -0.2 to 5.8 hours). Intervention parents reported using ECEC to support their children's social development more frequently than controls (48% vs 33%) but less for work/study (39% vs 46%).

Dissemination of evidence-based recommendations and knowledge brokering have emerged as potential strategies to achieve evidence implementation by influencing resource allocation decisions. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of these two research implementation strategies to facilitate evidence-informed healthcare management decisions for the provision of inpatient weekend allied health services. Methods and findings This multicentre, single-blinded (data collection and analysis), three-group parallel cluster randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation was conducted in Australian and New Zealand hospitals between February 2018 and January 2020. Clustering and randomisation took place at the organisation level where weekend allied health staffing decisions were made (e.g., network of hospitals or single hospital). Hospital wards were nested within these decision-making structures. Three conditions were compared over a 12-month period: (1) usual practice waitlist control; (2) dissemination of written evidence-based practice recommendations; and (3) access to a webinar-based knowledge broker in addition to the recommendations. The primary outcome was the alignment of weekend allied health provision with practice recommendations at the cluster and ward levels, addressing the adoption, penetration, and fidelity to the recommendations. The secondary outcome was mean hospital length of stay at the ward level. Outcomes were collected at baseline and 12 months later. A total of 45 clusters (n = 833 wards) were randomised to either control (n = 15), recommendation (n = 16), or knowledge broker (n = 14) conditions. Four (9%) did not provide follow-up data, and no adverse events were recorded. No significant effect was found with either implementation strategy for the primary outcome at the cluster level (recommendation versus control √É≈Ω√Ç¬≤ 18.11 [95% CI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢8,721.81 to 8,758.02] p = 0.997; knowledge broker versus control √É≈Ω√Ç¬≤ 1.24 [95% CI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢6,992.60 to 6,995.07] p = 1.000; recommendation versus knowledge broker √É≈Ω√Ç¬≤ √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢9.12 [95% CI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢3,878.39 to 3,860.16] p = 0.996) or ward level (recommendation versus control √É≈Ω√Ç¬≤ 0.01 [95% CI 0.74 to 0.75] p = 0.983; knowledge broker versus control √É≈Ω√Ç¬≤ √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢0.12 [95% CI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢0.54 to 0.30] p = 0.581; recommendation versus knowledge broker √É≈Ω√Ç¬≤ √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢0.19 [√É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢1.04 to 0.65] p = 0.651). There was no significant effect between strategies for the secondary outcome at ward level (recommendation versus control √É≈Ω√Ç¬≤ 2.19 [95% CI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢1.36 to 5.74] p = 0.219; knowledge broker versus control √É≈Ω√Ç¬≤ √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢0.55 [95% CI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢1.16 to 0.06] p = 0.075; recommendation versus knowledge broker √É≈Ω√Ç¬≤ √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢3.75 [95% CI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢8.33 to 0.82] p = 0.102). None of the control or knowledge broker clusters transitioned to partial or full alignment with the recommendations. Three (20%) of the clusters who only received the written recommendations transitioned from nonalignment to partial alignment. Limitations include underpowering at the cluster level sample due to the grouping of multiple geographically distinct hospitals to avoid contamination. Conclusions Owing to a lack of power at the cluster level, this trial was unable to identify a difference between the knowledge broker strategy and dissemination of recommendations compared with usual practice for the promotion of evidence-informed resource allocation to inpatient weekend allied health services. Future research is needed to determine the interactions between different implementation strategies and healthcare contexts when translating evidence into healthcare practice. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2021 Sarkies et al.

SWAP IT has been reported to be effective. This study aims to determine the cost and cost effectiveness of the SWAP IT m-health intervention. The retrospective trial-based economic evaluation was conducted in 12 Catholic primary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Schools were randomised to intervention or usual care. The costs (AUD, 2019) were evaluated from societal perspectives. The direct cost to uptake the intervention and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated. ICERS were calculated for two outcomes: reduction in total kJ and reduction in discretionary kJ from the lunchbox. The total cost was calculated to be AUD 55, 467. The mean incremental cost per student to receive the intervention was calculated to be AUD 31/student. The cost per reduction in total lunchbox energy was AUD 0.54. The ICER for the reduction in energy from discretionary foods in the lunchbox was AUD 0.24. These findings suggest that this m-health intervention has potential to be cost effective in reducing the kilojoules from discretionary foods packed in school lunchboxes. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2021 by the authors.

A CP for screening and management of anxiety and depression in cancer patients (the ADAPT CP) was implemented in 12 Australian oncology services for 12 months, within a cluster randomised controlled trial of core versus enhanced implementation strategies. This paper compares staff-perceived acceptability and appropriateness of the ADAPT CP across study arms. Methods: Multi-disciplinary lead teams at each service tailored, planned, championed and implemented the CP. Staff at participating services, purposively selected for diversity, completed a survey and participated in an interview prior to implementation (T0), and at midpoint (6 months: T1) and end (12 months: T2) of implementation. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. Results: Seven metropolitan and 5 regional services participated. Questionnaires were completed by 106, 58 and 57 staff at T0, T1 and T2 respectively. Eighty-eight staff consented to be interviewed at T0, with 89 and 76 at T1 and T2 (response rates 70%, 66% and 57%, respectively). Acceptability/appropriateness, on the quantitative measure, was high at T0 (mean of 31/35) and remained at that level throughout the study, with no differences between staff from core versus enhanced services. Perceived burden was relatively low (mean of 11/20) with no change over time. Lowest scores and greatest variability pertained to perceived impact on workload, time and cost. Four major themes were identified: 1) Mental health is an important issue which ADAPT addresses; 2) ADAPT helps staff deliver best care, and reduces staff stress; 3) ADAPT is fit for purpose, for both cancer care services and patients; 4) ADAPT: a catalyst for change. Opposing viewpoints are outlined. Conclusions: This study demonstrated high staff-perceived acceptability and appropriateness of the ADAPT CP with regards to its focus, evidence-base, utility to staff and patients, and ability to create change. However, concerns remained regarding burden on staff and time commitment. Strategies from a policy and managerial level will likely be required to overcome the latter issues.

Objective: The aim of this study was to test whether an adapted mental health experience codesign intervention to improve recovery-orientation of services led to greater psychosocial recovery outcomes for service users. Design: A stepped wedge cluster randomized-controlled trial was conducted. Setting and Participants: Four Mental Health Community Support Services providers, 287 people living with severe mental illnesses, 61 carers and 120 staff were recruited across Victoria, Australia. Main Outcome Measures: The 24-item Revised Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS-R) measured individual psychosocial recovery. Results: A total of 841 observations were completed with 287 service users. The intention-to-treat analysis found RAS-R scores to be similar between the intervention (mean = 84.7, SD= 15.6) and control (mean = 86.5, SD= 15.3) phases; the adjusted estimated difference in the mean RAS-R score was √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢1.70 (95% confidence interval: √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢3.81 to 0.40; p =.11). Discussion: This first trial of an adapted mental health experience codesign intervention for psychosocial recovery outcomes found no difference between the intervention and control arms. Conclusions: More attention to the conditions that are required for eight essential mechanisms of change to support codesign processes and implementation is needed.

Barnes C.; Yoong S.L.; Nathan N.; Wolfenden L.; Wedesweiler T.; Kerr J.; Ward D.S.; Grady A.,Feasibility of a Web-Based Implementation Intervention to Improve Child Dietary Intake in Early Childhood Education and Care: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,2021,"Background: Internationally, the implementation of evidence-based healthy eating policies and practices within early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings that encourage children's healthy diet is recommended. Despite the existence of evidence-based healthy eating practices, research indicates that current implementation rates are inadequate. Web-based approaches provide a potentially effective and less costly approach to support ECEC staff with implementing nutrition policies and practices. Objective: The broad aim of this pilot randomized controlled trial is to assess the feasibility of assessing the impact of a web-based program together with health promotion officer (HPO) support on ECEC center implementation of healthy eating policies and practices. Specifically, we seek to describe the completion rate of study evaluation processes (participant consent and data collection rates); examine ECEC center uptake, acceptability, and appropriateness of the intervention and implementation strategies; understand the potential cost of delivering and receiving implementation support strategies; and describe the potential impact of the web-based intervention on the implementation of targeted healthy eating practices among centers in the intervention group. Methods: A 6-month pilot implementation trial using a cluster-randomized controlled trial design was conducted in 22 ECEC centers within the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia. Potentially eligible centers were distributed a recruitment package and telephoned by the research team to assess eligibility and obtain consent. Centers randomly allocated to the intervention group received access to a web-based program, together with HPO support (eg, educational outreach visit and local technical assistance) to implement 5 healthy eating practices. The web-based program incorporated audit with feedback, development of formal implementation blueprints, and educational materials to facilitate improvement in implementation. The centers allocated to the control group received the usual care. Results: Of the 57 centers approached for the study, 22 (47%) provided consent to participate. Data collection components were completed by 100% (22/22) of the centers. High uptake for implementation strategies provided by HPOs (10/11, 91% to 11/11, 100%) and the web-based program (11/11, 100%) was observed. At follow-up, intervention centers had logged on to the program at an average of 5.18 (SD 2.52) times. The web-based program and implementation support strategies were highly acceptable (10/11, 91% to 11/11, 100%). Implementation of 4 healthy eating practices improved in the intervention group, ranging from 19% (2/11) to 64% (7/11). Conclusions: This study provides promising pilot data to warrant the conduct of a fully powered implementation trial to assess the impact of the program on ECEC healthy eating practice implementation. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

A commonly reported barrier to students√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ PA, particularly among girls, are uniforms that are impractical (e.g. tunic/dress and black leather shoes). Modifying student uniforms may represent a simple intervention to enhance student PA. The primary aim of this trial was to assess the impact of a PA enabling uniform intervention (shorts, polo shirt and sports shoes) on girls√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and total PA i.e. counts per minute (cpm). Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 42 primary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Schools were randomized on one school day to the intervention group, where students wore a PA enabling uniform (their sports uniform) or a control group, where students wore their usual traditional uniform. Student PA was measured using wrist-worn Actigraph GT3X and GT9X accelerometers. Linear mixed models controlling for student characteristics were used to examine the effects of the intervention. Results: Of the 3351 eligible students, 2315 (69.1%) had parental consent and 2180 of these consenting students participated (94.2%) of which 1847 (84.7%) were included in the analysis. For the primary aim the study found no significant differences between girls at schools allocated to the intervention relative to the control on change in MVPA (0.76 min, 95% CI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 0.47 to 1.99, p = 0.22) or cpm (36.99, 95% CI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 13.88 to 87.86, p = 0.15). Exploratory analysis revealed small effects for a number of findings, including significant reduction in sedentary activity (√É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 1.77, 95% CI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 3.40 to √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 0.14, p = 0.035) among all students at schools allocated to the intervention, and non-significant improvements in girls√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ light intensity PA (1.47 min, 95% CI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 0.06 to 3.00, p = 0.059) and sedentary activity (√É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 2.23 min; 95% CI √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 4.49 to 0.02, p = 0.052). Conclusion: The findings suggests that the intervention may yield small improvements in some measure of PA and require substantiation in a larger RCT with longer-term follow-up. The inclusion of additional intervention components may be required to achieve more meaningful effects.

Maisey G.; Cattani M.; Devine A.; Lo J.; Dunican I.C.,The Sleep of Shift Workers in a Remote Mining Operation: Methodology for a Randomized Control Trial to Determine Evidence-Based Interventions,2021,"Shiftwork may adversely impact an individual√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s sleep-wake patterns and result in sleep loss (<6 h. following night shift), due to the circadian misalignment and the design of rosters and shifts. Within a mining operation, this sleep loss may have significant consequences due to fatigue, including an increased risk of accidents and chronic health conditions. This study aims to (i) determine the efficacy of an intervention that comprises a sleep education program and biofeedback through a smartphone app on sleep quality, quantity, and alertness (ii) determine the prevalence of risk for a potential sleep disorder, and (iii) quantify and describe the sleep habits and behaviors of shift workers in a remote mining operation. This study consists of a randomized controlled trial whereby eighty-eight shift workers within a remote mining operation are randomized to a control group or one of three different treatment groups that are: (i) a sleep education program, (ii) biofeedback on sleep through a smartphone app, or (iii) a sleep education program and biofeedback on sleep through a smartphone app. This study utilizes wrist-activity monitors, biomathematical modeling, and a survey instrument to obtain data on sleep quantity, quality, and alertness. A variety of statistical methods will determine the prevalence of risk for a potential sleep disorder and associations with body mass index, alcohol, and caffeine consumption. A generalized linear mixed model will examine the dependent sleep variables assessed at baseline and post-intervention for the control group and intervention groups, as well as within and between groups to determine changes. The findings from this study will contribute to the current understanding of sleep and alertness behaviors, and sleep problems and disorders amongst shift workers. Importantly, the results may inform fatigue policy and practice on interventions to manage fatigue risk within the mining industry. This study protocol may have a broader application in other shiftwork industries, including oil and gas, aviation, rail, and healthcare. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© Copyright √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2021 Maisey, Cattani, Devine, Lo and Dunican.",10.3389/fnins.2020.579668,Health,,,,Field experiment,A regular RCT,88,"The provided text is an abstract of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial, not the results of the study.

Faulkner N.; Wright B.; Lennox A.; Bismark M.; Boag J.; Boffa S.; Waxman B.; Watson-Kruse J.; Paine G.; Bragge P.,Simulation-based training for increasing health service board members' effectiveness: A cluster randomised controlled trial,2020,"Objectives There is a paucity of research on how to improve the functioning of health service boards, despite their importance in influencing patient care. We examined the impact of simulation-based training on health service board members' perceptions of their skills in communicating during board meetings and of board meeting processes. Design Prospective, cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting Health service boards in Victoria, Australia. Participants Twelve boards were randomised, and pre- and post-intervention data were collected and analysed from 57 members of these boards. Interventions Boards were randomly allocated to either a treatment condition in which they received a 2-hour simulation-based training session or to a wait list control condition. Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary outcome variables were board members' perceptions regarding: (1) their skill and confidence in communicating during board meetings and (2) processes at their board meetings. Measures were collected in the intervention group before and 3 months post-training and compared with a wait list control group. Results Skills and confidence in communicating during board meetings was higher after training (control marginal mean=5.11, intervention marginal mean=5.42, mean difference=0.31, 90% CI (-0.03 to 0.66), one-sided p=0.068, d=0.40). Board meeting processes were also improved after training (control marginal mean=4.97, intervention marginal mean=5.37, mean difference=0.40, 90% CI (0.14 to 0.65), one-sided p=0.005, d=0.54). Conclusions Simulation-based training appeared to improve board members' skills and confidence, and perceptions of board meeting processes.

Healthy Recovery is an 8-session group-based intervention that targets smoking, diet and physical inactivity as part of an integrated healthy lifestyle approach. The current study aimed to examine the effectiveness of Healthy Recovery when delivered within residential AOD treatment settings. Methods: The study design was a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial. Participants were 151 current smokers attending residential AOD programs provided by the Australian Salvation Army (n = 71, Control condition; n = 80, Intervention condition). The primary outcome was number of cigarettes smoked per day. Secondary outcomes examined other smoking behaviours (7-day point prevalence, use of nicotine replacement therapy [NRT]), diet (servings and variety of fruit and vegetables), and physical activity. Results: The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day was significantly lower in the Intervention condition at 2-, 5-, and 8-month follow-up. There were also significant differences in favour of the Intervention condition for number of quit attempts, use of NRT and variety of fruit. There were no other significant differences for other dietary or physical activity variables. Conclusions: Healthy Recovery had a positive impact on smoking behaviours. Future research should consider strategies to further promote smoking cessation (e.g. promoting longer-term use of NRT), as well as addressing physical activity and dietary behaviours. The introduction of broader organisational approaches (e.g. smoke free policies, organised group exercise and cooking activities) might help to enhance healthy lifestyle approaches within AOD treatment settings. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2021",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108557,Health,,,,Field experiment,A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial,151,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Interventions that are effective and scalable targeting the school and home environment are therefore warranted. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a multicomponent, mobile health-based intervention, SWAP IT, in reducing the energy contribution of discretionary (ie, less healthy) foods and drinks packed for children to consume at school. Methods: A type I effectiveness-implementation hybrid cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 32 primary schools located across 3 local health districts in New South Wales, Australia, to compare the effects of a 6-month intervention targeting foods packed in children's lunchboxes with those of a usual care control. Primary schools were eligible if they were not participating in other nutrition studies and used the required school communication app. The Behaviour Change Wheel was used to co-design the multicomponent SWAP IT intervention, which consisted of the following: school lunchbox nutrition guidelines, curriculum lessons, information pushed to parents digitally via an existing school communication app, and additional parent resources to address common barriers to packing healthy lunchboxes. The primary outcome, mean energy (kilojoules) content of discretionary lunchbox foods and drinks packed in lunchboxes, was measured via observation using a validated school food checklist at baseline (May 2019) and at 6-month follow-up (October 2019). Additional secondary outcomes included mean lunchbox energy from discretionary foods consumed, mean total lunchbox energy packed and consumed, mean energy content of core lunchbox foods packed and consumed, and percentage of lunchbox energy from discretionary and core foods, all of which were also measured via observation using a validated school food checklist. Measures of school engagement, consumption of discretionary foods outside of school hours, and lunchbox cost were also collected at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Data were analyzed via hierarchical linear regression models, with controlling for clustering, socioeconomic status, and remoteness. Results: A total of 3022 (3022/7212, 41.90%) students consented to participate in the evaluation (mean age 7.8 years; 1487/3022, 49.22% girls). There were significant reductions between the intervention and control groups in the primary trial outcome, mean energy (kilojoules) content of discretionary foods packed in lunchboxes (-117.26 kJ; 95% CI -195.59 to -39.83; P=.003). Relative to the control, the intervention also significantly reduced secondary outcomes regarding the mean total lunchbox energy (kilojoules) packed (-88.38 kJ; 95% CI -172.84 to -3.92; P=.04) and consumed (-117.17 kJ; 95% CI -233.72 to -0.62; P=.05). There was no significant difference between groups in measures of student engagement, consumption of discretionary foods outside of school hours, or cost of foods packed in children's lunchboxes. Conclusions: The SWAP IT intervention was effective in reducing the energy content of foods packed for and consumed by primary school-aged children at school. Dissemination of the SWAP IT program at a population level has the potential to influence a significant proportion of primary school-aged children, impacting weight status and associated health care costs. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© Rachel Sutherland, Alison Brown, Nicole Nathan, Serene Yoong, Lisa Janssen, Amelia Chooi, Nayerra Hudson, John Wiggers, Nicola Kerr, Nicole Evans, Karen Gillham, Christopher Oldmeadow, Andrew Searles, Penny Reeves, Marc Davies, Kathryn Reilly, Brad Cohen, Luke Wolfenden.

PA4E1 has seven PA practices. It is essential to scale-up, evaluate effectiveness and assess implementation of such programs. Therefore, the aim is to assess the impact of implementation support on school practice uptake of the PA4E1 program at 12 and 24 months. Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial, utilising a type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness design, was conducted in 49 randomly selected disadvantaged Australian Government and Catholic secondary schools. A blinded statistician randomly allocated schools to a usual practice control (n = 25) or the PA4E1 program group (n = 24), with the latter receiving seven implementation support strategies to support school PA practice uptake of the seven practices retained from the efficacy trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of schools adopting at least four of the seven practices, assessed via telephone surveys with Head Physical Education Teachers and analysed using exact logistic regression modelling. This paper reports the 12-month outcomes. Results: Schools were recruited from May to November 2017. At baseline, no schools implemented four of the seven practices. At 12 months significantly more schools in the program group had implemented four of the seven practices (16/24, 66.7%) than the control group (1/25, 4%) (OR = 33.0[4.15-1556.4], p < 0.001). The program group implemented on average 3.2 (2.5-3.9) more practices than the control group (p < 0.001, mean 3.9 (SD 1.5) vs 0.7 (1.0)). Fidelity and reach of the implementation support intervention were high (both > 80%). Conclusions: Through the application of multiple implementation support strategies, secondary schools were able to overcome commonly known barriers to implement evidence based school PA practices. As such practices have been shown to result in an increase in adolescent PA and improvements in weight status, policy makers and practitioners responsible for advocating PA in schools should consider this implementation approach more broadly when working with schools. Follow-up is required to determine whether practice implementation is sustained.

Fehily C.; Ling R.; Searles A.; Bartlem K.; Wiggers J.; Hodder R.; Wilson A.; Colyvas K.; Bowman J.,An economic evaluation of a specialist preventive care clinician in a community mental health service: A randomised controlled trial,2020,"Background: Clinical practice guidelines and policies direct community mental health services to provide preventive care to address chronic disease risks, however, such care is infrequently provided in routine consultations. An alternative model of care is to appoint a clinician to the dedicated role of offering and providing preventive care in an additional consultation: the 'specialist clinician' model. Economic evaluations of models of care are needed to determine the cost of adhering to guidelines and policies, and to inform pragmatic service delivery decisions. This study is an economic evaluation of the specialist clinician model; designed to achieve policy concordant preventive care delivery. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the incremental costs, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of a 'specialist preventive care clinician' (an occupational therapist) was conducted in a randomised controlled trial, where participants were randomised to receive usual care; or usual care plus the offer of an additional preventive care consultation with the specialist clinician. The study outcome was client acceptance of referrals to two free telephone-based chronic disease prevention services. This is a key care delivery outcome mandated by the local health district policy of the service. The base case analysis assumed the mental health service cost perspective. A budget impact analysis determined the annual budget required to implement the model of care for all clients of the community mental health service over 5 years. Results: There was a significantly greater increase from baseline to follow-up in the proportion of intervention participants accepting referrals to both telephone services, compared to usual care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $347 per additional acceptance of a referral (CI: $263-$494). The annual budget required to implement the model of care for all prospective clients was projected to be $711,446 over 5-years; resulting in 2616 accepted referrals. Conclusions: The evaluation provides key information regarding the costs for the mental health service to adhere to policy targets, indicating the model of care involved a low per client cost whilst increasing key preventive care delivery outcomes. Additional modelling is required to further explore its economic benefits. Trial registration: ACTRN12616001519448.

Objectives: This study aims to examine the impact of a web-based program and support to implement dietary guidelines in childcare centers on children's 1) diet; 2) BMI z scores; and 3) child health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: This study was a cluster-randomized controlled trial utilizing a Type-3 Hybrid implementation-effectiveness design conducted between October 2016 and March 2018. This study reports on child outcomes. Fifty-four childcare centers in New South Wales, Australia were randomly assigned to the intervention (a web-based menu-planning tool and support) or control group (usual care). The intervention was designed to address barriers and enablers to dietary guideline implementation according to the Theoretical Domains Framework. A quota of 35 consenting childcare centers undertook child-level evaluation of dietary intake where 522 parents consented to completing √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬•1 component of data collection for their child. Child consumption of core and discretionary (unhealthy) foods while in care was assessed via dietary observations by blinded research assistants, childcare diet quality was assessed via educator-completed questionnaires, BMI z scores were assessed via measured weight and height, and child HRQoL was assessed via parent report at baseline and 12-mo follow-up. Results: There was a significant increase in mean child consumption of fruit (0.39 servings; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.65 servings) and dairy foods (0.38 servings; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.57 servings) and a significant reduction in consumption of discretionary foods (-0.40 servings; 95% CI: -0.64, -0.16 servings) in care in the intervention group, relative to control at 12-mo follow-up. No significant differences were observed in diet quality, BMI z scores, or HRQoL. Conclusions: A web-based intervention to support planning of childcare menus consistent with dietary guidelines can improve child consumption of healthier foods in daycare.

Pettigrew S.; Jongenelis M.I.; Jackson B.; Warburton J.; Newton R.U.,A randomized controlled trial and pragmatic analysis of the effects of volunteering on the health and well-being of older people,2020,"Background: Volunteering among older people has the potential to deliver health benefits to the individual, along with economic and social benefits to society. However, it is not clear whether healthier people are more likely to engage in volunteering, whether volunteering improves health, or the extent to which the relationship may be reciprocal. There is an identified need for longitudinal work, especially in the form of randomized controlled trials, to establish causality. Aims: To assess the effects of commencing volunteering among older non-volunteers utilizing a randomized controlled trial approach involving per-protocol and pragmatic analyses. Methods: Of the 445 Australians aged 60 + years who participated in the study, 201 were assigned to an intervention arm that required them to participate in a minimum of 1√É‚Äö√Ç¬†h/week of formal volunteering in a position of their choice. The remaining participants were assigned to a control condition and asked to continue their lives as usual, but were not discouraged from commencing volunteering. Results: Across the assessed physical, psychological, and social variables, a significant difference in sit-to-stand scores was found in both the per-protocol and pragmatic analyses, and a further significant difference in the fast pace walk was identified in the pragmatic analyses. Conclusion: The results provide some support for policies and programs designed to encourage older people to engage in volunteering to maintain or improve their health.

This paper explores motivators for university nursing students to participate in MHFA training and uses previous experience and confidence in assisting someone with a mental health problem to triangulate data. Method: A randomised controlled trial was employed to measure the impact of the course for nursing students at a large Western Australian university. An online survey was administered prior to MHFA training with undergraduate nursing students (n = 140). Thematic analysis of open-ended questions explores motivators to participate and help provided to an individual. Baseline frequencies describe demographics, confidence in helping and exposure to someone with a mental health problem. A Chi Square test compared confidence in helping and exposure to someone with a mental health problem. Results: More than half of participants reported contact with individuals experiencing mental health problems (55%; n = 77); approximately a third (35.8%) reported limited confidence to assist. Those in previous contact with someone with a mental health problem (71.5%; n = 55) were significantly more likely to feel confident in helping (p = 0.044). Mental health literacy, helping others, career and experiences were described as training motivators. Conclusion: Exploiting motivators, both intrinsic and extrinsic may increase MHFA training uptake and completion. Tertiary institutions would benefit from policy to embed MHFA training into nursing degrees. The training may have utility for university degrees more broadly.

Menzies R.; Heron L.; Lampard J.; McMillan M.; Joseph T.; Chan J.; Storken A.; Marshall H.,A randomised controlled trial of SMS messaging and calendar reminders to improve vaccination timeliness in infants,2020,"Background: The effectiveness of SMS reminders in improving vaccination coverage has been assessed previously, with effectiveness varying between settings. However, there are very few studies on their effect on the timeliness of vaccination. Design: Unblinded, randomised controlled trial with blocked sampling. Methods: 1594 Australian infants and young children were recruited to assess the impact of (1) SMS reminders only, (2) a personalised calendar, (3) SMS reminder and personalised calendar and (4) no intervention, on receipt of vaccine within 30 days of the due date. Outcomes were measured for receipt of vaccines due at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 18 months of age. A post-hoc assessment was also conducted of the impact of a new national √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚ÄúNo jab No Pay√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù policy introduced during the trial, which removed philosophical objections as an exemption for financial penalties for non-vaccination. Results: There was a statistically significant improvement in on-time vaccination only at the 12 month schedule point amongst infants who received SMS reminders alone (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì1.18) or in combination with a personalised calendar (1.11, CI 1.03√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì1.20) compared to controls. This impact was limited to participants who had received one or more previous doses late. No statistically significant impacts of calendar interventions alone were seen. There was a high rate of on-time compliance amongst control participants √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ 95%, 86%, 80%, 74% at the 4, 6, 12 and 18 month schedule points respectively, which increased more than 10 percentage points after implementation of the √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚ÄúNo Jab, No Pay√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù policy. Conclusions: SMS reminders are more effective in improving timeliness where pre-existing compliance is lower, but the 18 month schedule point appeared to be less amenable to intervention.

Sunner C.; Giles M.T.; Parker V.; Dilworth S.; Bantawa K.; Kable A.; Oldmeadow C.; Foureur M.,PACE-IT study protocol: A stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial evaluating the implementation of telehealth visual assessment in emergency care for people living in residential aged-care facilities,2020,"Background: Transfer of residential aged-care facility (RACF) residents to Emergency Departments (ED) is common, risky and expensive. RACF residents who present to ED are more likely to have hospital readmissions, longer stays and face major risks related to hospital acquired complications. Aged Care Emergency services (ACE) is a nurse led, protocol-guided, telephone RACF/ED outreach model that has been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalisation and length of hospital stay for RACF residents in the Hunter New England Local Health District, New South Wales (NSW). The Partnerships in Aged-Care Emergency services using Interactive Telehealth (PACE-IT) project enhances ACE by incorporating interactive video assessment and consultation. The PACE-IT project's primary aim is to assess whether augmentation of ACE services through the addition of protocol-guided interactive Visual Telehealth Consultation (VTC) for clinical decision-making, plus telephone follow-up, reduces RACF resident transfers to ED. Methods: A stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted. The intervention will be delivered sequentially to 8 clusters; each cluster comprises one ED and two RACFs in NSW, Australia. The 16 RACFs in the study will be selected for order of implementation using a computer-generated randomisation sequence. A 2-step randomisation process will be undertaken, randomising the hospital EDs first and then randomising the RACFs aligned with each hospital. The PACE-IT intervention comprises: An initial phone call by RACFs to the ACE service in the ED; the ACE service in ED responds with a protocol-guided VTC, a management plan agreed between all participants; an automated consultation summary letter to the General Practitioner and the RACF; a post VTC 24 h follow-up phone call to the RACF. Discussion: If shown to be effective, the intervention has the potential to improve the clinical care and quality of life for residents. Findings will provide high level evidence that will inform sustainable change and broad translation into practice across NSW. It will show how the change has been achieved and highlight success factors for scalability and sustainability. It will inform review of processes, the development of policy and guidelines that will integrate PACE-IT into existing service models in NSW.

A six-month three-arm parallel group randomised controlled trial was undertaken with 69 services, randomised to one of three arms: high-intensity strategies (executive support; group face-to-face training; provision of resources; multiple rounds of audit and feedback; ongoing face-to-face and phone support); low-intensity strategies (group face-to-face training; provision of resources; single round of audit and feedback); or usual care control. Across all study arms, only three high-intensity services were compliant with overall nutrition guidelines. A significant group interaction was found between the three arms for compliance with individual food groups. Relative to control, a significantly greater proportion of low-intensity services were compliant with dairy, and a significantly greater proportion of high-intensity services were compliant with fruit, vegetables, dairy, breads and cereals, and discretionary foods. No significant differences between the high-and low-intensity for individual food group compliance were found. High-intensity implementation strategies may be effective in supporting childcare service implementation of individual food group recommendations. Further research is warranted to identify strategies effective in increasing overall nutrition compliance. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2020 by the authors.

To achieve the World Health Organization hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination targets, it is essential to increase access to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), especially among people who inject drugs (PWID). We aimed to determine the effectiveness of providing DAAs in primary care, compared with hospital-based specialist care. Methods. We randomized PWID with HCV attending primary care sites in Australia or New Zealand to receive DAAs at their primary care site or local hospital (standard of care [SOC]). The primary outcome was to determine whether people treated in primary care had a noninferior rate of sustained virologic response at Week 12 (SVR12), compared to historical controls (consistent with DAA trials at the time of the study design); secondary outcomes included comparisons of treatment initiation, SVR12 rates, and the care cascade by study arm. Results. We recruited 140 participants and randomized 136: 70 to the primary care arm and 66 to the SOC arm. The SVR12 rate (100%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 87.7-100) of people treated in primary care was noninferior when compared to historical controls (85% assumed). An intention-to-treat analysis revealed that the proportion of participants commencing treatment in the primary care arm (75%, 43/57) was significantly higher than in the SOC arm (34%, 18/53; P < .001; relative risk [RR] 2.48, 95% CI 1.54-3.95), and the proportion of participants with SVR12 was significantly higher in the primary care arm, compared to in the SOC arm (49% [28/57] and 30% [16/53], respectively; P = .043; RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.0-2.65). Conclusions. Providing HCV treatment in primary care increases treatment uptake and cure rates. Approaches that increase treatment uptake among PWID will accelerate elimination strategies.

Individuals involved in organised sport have been identified as one population group who consume risky amounts of alcohol both at the elite and the non-elite level. 'Good Sports', an alcohol management intervention focused on the community sports setting has been successful in addressing risky alcohol use and alcohol-related harm amongst players and sports fans. Sustaining such implementation effects is a common challenge across a variety of community settings. The primary aim of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of a web-based program in sustaining the implementation of best-practice alcohol management practices by community football clubs, relative to usual program care (i.e. control clubs). Methods: Non-elite, community football clubs in the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria, that were participating in an alcohol management program (Good Sports) were recruited for the study. Consenting clubs were randomised into intervention (N = 92) or control (N = 96) groups. A web-based sustainability intervention was delivered to intervention clubs over three consecutive Australian winter sports seasons (April-September 2015-2017). The intervention was designed to support continued (sustained) implementation of alcohol management practices at clubs consistent with the program. Control group clubs received usual support from the national Good Sports Program. Primary outcome data was collected through observational audits of club venues and grounds. Results: A total of 92 intervention clubs (574 members) and 96 control clubs (612 members) were included in the final analysis. At follow-up, sustained implementation of alcohol management practices was high in both groups and there was no significant difference between intervention or control clubs at follow-up for both the proportion of clubs implementing 10 or more practices (OR 0.53, 95%CI 0.04-7.2; p = 0.63) or for the mean number of practices being implemented (mean difference 0.10, 95%CI -0.23-0.42; p = 0.55). There were also no significant differences between groups on measures of alcohol consumption by club members. Conclusions: The findings suggest that sustained implementation of alcohol management practices was high, and similar, between clubs receiving web-based implementation support or usual program support.

Clinton-Mcharg T.; Gonzalez S.; Milner S.; Sherker S.; Kingsland M.; Lecathelinais C.; Hall A.; Doran C.; Wiggers J.; Wolfenden L.,Implementing health policies in Australian junior sports clubs: An RCT,2019,"Background: This pilot study aimed to test the potential effectiveness and acceptability of an intervention to support the implementation of 16 recommended policies and practices to improve the health promotion environment of junior sporting clubs. Reported child exposure to health promoting practices at clubs was also assessed. Methods: A cluster randomised trial was conducted with eight football leagues. Fourty-one junior football clubs belonging to four leagues in the intervention group received support (e.g. physical resources, recognition and rewards, systems and prompts) to implement 16 policies and practices that targeted child exposure to alcohol, tobacco, healthy food and beverages, and participation in physical activity. Thirty-eight clubs belonging to the four control group leagues did not receive the implementation intervention. Study outcomes were assessed via telephone interviews with nominated club representatives and parents of junior players. Between group differences in the mean number of policies and practices implemented at the club level at follow-up were examined using a multiple linear regression model. Results: While the intervention was found to be acceptable, there was no significant difference between the mean number of practices and policies reported to be implemented by intervention and control clubs at post-intervention (Estimate - 0.05; 95% CI -0.91, 0.80; p = 0.90). There was also no significant difference in the proportion of children reported to be exposed to: alcohol (OR 1.16; 95% CI 0.41, 3.28; p = 0.78); tobacco (OR 0.97; CI 0.45, 2.10; p = 0.94); healthy food purchases (OR 0.49; CI 0.11, 2.27; p = 0.35); healthy drink purchases (OR 1.48; CI 0.72, 3.05; p = 0.27); or participation in physical activity (OR 0.76; CI 0.14, 4.08; p = 0.74).

Research has examined an array of risk factors implicated in predicting violent offending, but interventions aimed at reducing these risk factors and their effect on violence have been less investigated, especially those within a randomized trial. We use data from a truancy reduction experiment in Australia to examine whether participants in the program, relative to a control group, enjoyed ancillary benefits related to the relationship between risk factors and violence. Results provide partial support in that the program weakened the effects of some of the risk factors on violence over time, but not all of the risk factors. Findings also show that the probability of violence was higher in the control group relative to the experimental group when looking at the cumulative social risk factors.

An increasing number of older Australians use complementary medicine (CM). We examined the effectiveness of a CM educational intervention delivered using a web or DVD plus booklet format to increase older adults' decision self-efficacy and health literacy. Methods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted. We recruited individuals aged over 65 years living in retirement villages or participating in community groups, in Sydney Australia. Participants were randomly allocated to receive a CM education intervention delivered using a website or DVD plus booklet versus booklet only. The primary outcome was decision self-efficacy. A secondary outcome included the Preparation for Decision-Making scale and health literacy. Outcomes were collected at 3 weeks, and 2 months from baseline, and analysed using an adjusted ANOVA, or repeated measures ANOVA. Result: We randomised 153 participants. Follow up at 3 weeks and 2 months was completed by 131 participants. There was a 14% (n = 22) attrition rate. At the end of the intervention, we found no significant differences between groups for decision self-efficacy (mean difference (MD) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.0 to 9.6 p = 0.20), there were no differences between groups on nine health literacy domains, and the Preparation for Decision-Making scale. Over 80% of participants in both groups rated the content as excellent or good. Conclusion: Decision self-efficacy improved for participants, but did not differ between groups. Decision self-efficacy and health literacy outcomes were not influenced by the delivery of education using a website, DVD or booklet. Participants found the resources useful, and rated the content as good or excellent. CM Web or DVD and booklet resources have the potential for wider application.

Web-based systems offer unique opportunities to support the implementation of such guidelines. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a Web-based menu planning intervention in increasing the mean number of food groups on childcare service menus that comply with dietary guidelines. Secondary aims were to assess the impact of the intervention on the proportion of service menus compliant with recommendations for (1) all food groups; (2) individual food groups; and (3) mean servings of individual food groups. Childcare service use and acceptability of the Web-based program were also assessed. Methods: A single-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was undertaken with 54 childcare services in New South Wales, Australia. Services were randomized to a 12-month intervention or usual care control. Intervention services received access to a Web-based menu planning program linked to their usual childcare management software system. Childcare service compliance with dietary guidelines and servings of food groups were assessed at baseline, 3-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up. Results: No significant differences in the mean number of food groups compliant with dietary guidelines and the proportion of service menus compliant with recommendations for all food groups, or for individual food groups, were found at 3- or 12-month follow-up between the intervention and control groups. Intervention service menus provided significantly more servings of fruit (P<.001), vegetables (P=.03), dairy (P=.03), and meat (P=.003), and reduced their servings of discretionary foods (P=.02) compared with control group at 3 months. This difference was maintained for fruit (P=.03) and discretionary foods (P=.003) at 12 months. Intervention childcare service staff logged into the Web-based program an average of 40.4 (SD 31.8) times and rated the program as highly acceptable. Conclusions: Although improvements in childcare service overall menu and individual food group compliance with dietary guidelines were not statistically significant, findings indicate that a Web-based menu planning intervention can improve the servings for some healthy food groups and reduce the provision of discretionary foods. Future research exploring the effectiveness of differing strategies in improving the implementation of dietary guidelines in childcare services is warranted. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Conclusion: The intervention was effective in achieving long-term school adherence to a state-wide canteen policy at 24-month follow-up.

It places significant resource pressure on health systems and financial stress on smokers with SMI (SSMI). Telephone-based smoking cessation interventions have been shown to be cost effective in general populations. However, evidence suggests that SSMI are less likely to be referred to quitlines, and little is known about the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of such interventions that specifically target SSMI. The Quitlink randomized controlled trial for accessible smoking cessation support for SSMI aims to bridge this gap. This paper describes the protocol for evaluating the cost effectiveness of Quitlink. Methods: Quitlink will be implemented in the Australian setting, utilizing the existing mental health peer workforce to link SSMI to a tailored quitline service. The effectiveness of Quitlink will be evaluated in a clustered randomized controlled trial. A cost-effectiveness evaluation will be conducted alongside the Quitlink clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) calculated for the cost (AUD) per successful quit and quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained at 8 months compared with usual care from both health care system and limited societal perspectives. Financial implications for study participants will also be investigated. A modeled cost-effectiveness analysis will also be conducted to estimate future costs and benefits associated with any treatment effect observed during the trial. Results will be extrapolated to estimate the cost effectiveness of rolling out Quitlink nationally. Sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to assess the impact on results from plausible variations in all modeled variables. Discussion: SSMI require additional support to quit. Quitlink utilizes existing peer worker and quitline workforces and tailors quitline support specifically to provide that increased cessation support. Given Quitlink engages these existing skilled workforces, it is hypothesized that, if found to be effective, it will also be found to be both cost effective and scalable. This protocol describes the economic evaluation of Quitlink that will assess these hypotheses. Ethics and dissemination: Full ethics clearances have been received for the methods described below from the University of Newcastle (Australia) Human Research Ethics Committee (H-2018-0192) and St Vincent√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s Hospital, Melbourne (HREC/18/SVHM/154). The trial has been registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12619000244101). Participant consent is sought both to participate in the study and to have the study data linked to routine health administrative data on publicly subsidized health service and pharmaceutical use, specifically the Medicare Benefits and Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemes (MBS/PBS). Trial findings (including economic evaluation) will be published in peer reviewed journals and presented at international conferences. Collected data and analyses will be made available in accordance with journal policies and study ethics approvals. Results will be presented to relevant government authorities with an interest in cost effectiveness of these types of interventions. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© Copyright √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2019 Sweeney, Moodie, Baker, Borland, Castle, Segan, Turner, Attia, Kelly, Brophy, Bonevski, Williams, Baird, White and McCarter.",10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00618,Health,,,,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,_,"The provided text is a protocol for an economic evaluation of the Quitlink randomized controlled trial, not the results of the study itself.

Methods: An online survey was administered to 1,033 Australian adults who were randomly allocated to one of four conditions: black and white (B&W) full HSR, colour full HSR, B&W star rating only, and colour star rating only. Each respondent viewed four packs of breakfast cereal of varying levels of healthiness as indicated by the displayed HSRs. Respondents nominated the product option they would prefer to buy and then the one they understood to be healthiest. Results: Coloured HSR variations scored better than their B&W counterparts and the star-only versions scored better than the corresponding versions displaying nutrient icons. Overall, the coloured star-only HSR performed significantly better than the B&W full HSR for both choice and understanding. Conclusions: Increasing the interpretive nature of the HSR could enhance its effectiveness.

Design: Parallel group randomized controlled trial. Setting: Hunter New England region, New South Wales, Australia. Participants: Forty-four childcare centers that prepare and provide food on-site to children while in care. Intervention: The intervention was designed using the Theoretical Domains Framework, targeted managers, and cooks and included implementation strategies that addressed identified barriers. Measures: Outcomes included the proportion of menus providing food servings (per child) compliant with overall nutrition guideline recommendations and each individual food group assessed via menu assessments. Cook knowledge of recommendations, intervention acceptability, adverse events, and barriers were also assessed via questionnaires with cooks and managers. Analysis: Logistic regression models, adjusted for baseline values of the outcome. Results: At baseline and follow-up, zero centers in the intervention and control groups were compliant with the overall menu guidelines or for the vegetable and meat food groups. Follow-up between-group differences in compliance for discretionary (33.3 vs 5, P =.18), dairy (41.7 vs 15, P =.16), breads and cereals (8.3 vs 10 P = 1.00), and fruit (16.7 vs 10, P =.48) were all nonsignificant. Relative to the control group, intervention centers showed a significantly greater increase in percentage of cooks with correct knowledge for vegetable servings (93.3 vs 36.4, P =.008). Conclusion: Although the application of the theoretical framework produced a broader understanding of the determinants of menu compliance, due to the complexity of guidelines, limited follow-up support, lower training uptake, and low intervention dose, the intervention was not effective in supporting the practice change required. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© The Author(s) 2018.",10.1177/0890117118786859,Nutrition and exercise,,,,Field experiment,Parallel group randomized controlled trial,44,"The study did not show statistically significant results for the primary outcomes.

Moore B.; Woodcock S.; Dudley D.,Developing wellbeing through a randomised controlled trial of a martial arts based intervention: An alternative to the anti-bullying approach,2019,"Anti-bullying policies and interventions are the main approach addressing bullying behaviours in Australian schools. However, the evidence supporting these approaches is inconsistent and its theoretical underpinning may be problematic. The current study examined the effects of a martial arts based psycho-social intervention on participants√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ ratings of resilience and self-efficacy, delivered as a randomised controlled trial to 283 secondary school students. Results found a consistent pattern for strengths-based wellbeing outcomes. All measures relating to resilience and self-efficacy improved for the intervention group, whereas results declined for the control group. These findings suggest that a martial arts based psycho-social intervention may be an efficacious method of improving wellbeing outcomes including resilience and self-efficacy. The study proposes utilising alternatives to the anti-bullying approach and that interventions should be aimed towards helping individuals develop strengths and cope more effectively, which has specific relevance to bullying and more generalised importance to positive mental health. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2018 by the authors.

Blake M.R.; Lancsar E.; Peeters A.; Backholer K.,The effect of sugar-sweetened beverage price increases and educational messages on beverage purchasing behavior among adults,2018,"There is a paucity of evidence regarding the impact of sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) price increases on beverage consumption, using individual-level data, for the population overall and for different socioeconomic groups. This study aimed to predict the impact of altered beverage prices and educational messages on consumer purchasing behavior. 2020 adults representative of the Australian population by age, gender and income completed a discrete choice experiment online in 2016. Each subject completed 20 choice scenarios in a hypothetical convenience store setting where subjects chose between seven SSB and non-SSB beverage options or a no beverage option. Beverage prices and volumes varied between scenarios. Half of participants (n = 1012) were randomly exposed to an educational poster discouraging SSB consumption prior to completing choice scenarios. We used discrete choice models to predict purchases under several policy proposals, overall and for income and SSB consumption frequency sub-groups. Compared to baseline prices, a 10% SSB price increase was predicted to reduce SSB purchases by 15.0% [95%CI -15.2, √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢14.7], and increase purchases of non-SSBs by +11.0% [95%CI 10.8, 11.2] and no beverage by +15.5% [95%CI 15.1, 15.9]. Effects were greater with a 20% SSB price increase. Across all policy scenarios, the highest income quintile had a similar absolute and slightly greater relative decrease in SSB purchases compared to the lowest quintile. Educational poster exposure reduced SSB choice for all groups, with a greater reduction in the lower compared to higher income group, and additively increased response to price changes. Our results support the use of population-wide SSB pricing and educational interventions to reduce demand across all income groups. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.appet.2018.03.012,Nutrition and exercise,,,,Survey experiment,A regular RCT,2020,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Finch M.; Stacey F.; Jones J.; Yoong S.L.; Grady A.; Wolfenden L.,A randomised controlled trial of performance review and facilitated feedback to increase implementation of healthy eating and physical activity-promoting policies and practices in centre-based childcare,2019,"Background: While it is recommended that childcare services implement policies and practices to support obesity prevention, there remains limited evidence to inform policy and practice. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of performance review and facilitated feedback in increasing the implementation of healthy eating and physical activity-promoting policies and practices in childcare services. Methods: The study was conducted with childcare services in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia. Eligible services were randomised to a wait-list control group or to receive the implementation strategy. The strategy targeted the implementation of written nutrition, physical activity, and small screen recreation policies; providing information to families regarding healthy eating, physical activity, and small screen time; providing twice weekly healthy eating learning experiences to children; providing water and plain milk only to children; providing fundamental movement skills activities for children every day; and limiting the use of electronic screen time for educational purposes and learning experiences. Intervention services received a performance review and facilitated feedback process five times over the 10 months that included an assessment of current practices, goal setting, identification of barriers to implementation, problem-solving, and resource provision. The primary outcome was the proportion of services implementing all six policies and practices, assessed by nominated supervisor completion of a computer-assisted telephone interview at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Results: One hundred and eight services took part. There were no significant differences in the proportion of services implementing all six practices at 12 months (mean difference 0.51; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.58; p = 0.24). There were also no differences between groups in the mean number of policies and practices implemented (mean difference 0.1; 95% CI-0.4 to 0.6; p = 0.71), or the proportion implementing each of the six individual policies and practices at 12 months (OR range 0.57 to 1.85; p > 0.05). Conclusions: Further support may be required to assist childcare services to make recommended changes to their policies and practices.

Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) was used to evaluate the SSPSIS, which was conducted in NSW SunSmart schools (n√É‚Äö√Ç¬†=√É‚Äö√Ç¬†20). Objective measurements of students√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ sun-safe hat-wearing behaviours and sunscreen application, and teachers√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ role-modelling behaviours, were collected for baseline, post-test and follow-up data. Interviews with school community stakeholders, including students (n√É‚Äö√Ç¬†=√É‚Äö√Ç¬†103), parents (n√É‚Äö√Ç¬†=√É‚Äö√Ç¬†31), teachers (n√É‚Äö√Ç¬†=√É‚Äö√Ç¬†11) and executive staff (n√É‚Äö√Ç¬†=√É‚Äö√Ç¬†4), were conducted to inform the intervention design, which was implemented following baseline data collection. Results: The results of baseline observations and interviews have been published previously. The intervention design aimed to combat negative perceptions of hat-wearing policy and create a trigger for sunscreen application by rewarding students practising these sun protection behaviours with play-based incentives. Although this intervention had no significant effect on the wearing of sun-safe hats among students or teachers, it did have a large effect on the consumption of sunscreen. Conclusions: Associating sunscreen and play-based incentives can create an effective trigger for students√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ sunscreen application behaviours. However, further evidence is needed to investigate how students√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ and teacher role models√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ hat-wearing behaviours could be increased. So what?: While combining a play-based incentive with a trigger for behaviour can promptly increase students√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ sunscreen application, it was unable to increase students√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ or teacher role models√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ hat-wearing behaviours. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2017 Australian Health Promotion Association",10.1002/hpja.27,Health,,,,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,103,"The study did not show statistically significant results for the wearing of sun-safe hats among students or teachers.

To supplement national policies, it is important to trial community interventions as a potential strategy to prevent adolescent alcohol use. Methods: This study evaluated a multicomponent community intervention that included community mobilisation, social marketing, and the monitoring of alcohol sales to minors. Evaluation was a clustered randomised trial design with 14 intervention and 14 control communities. Prior to randomisation, communities were matched on socioeconomic status and location. Intervention communities were not blinded. Participants: 3545 Year 8 students (M = 12 years) were surveyed at baseline from 75 schools; 3377 students were surveyed post intervention in 2013 from 54 schools. Outcomes: It was hypothesised that the primary outcome, individual alcohol consumption in last 30 days, after the intervention would be 15% lower in intervention communities. Secondary outcomes were consumption in the past year and intention not to drink before age 18. Results: The intervention communities showed larger relative reductions compared to the controls in last 30-day consumption and past year (10%), but not significantly different. A significantly lower proportion of participants in the intervention community (63%), compared to the controls (71%), reported intending to drink before 18 years old. Subgroup analysis identified regional and state differences for some secondary measures. Conclusions: Intervention assignment was associated with lower adolescent intention to drink before the age of 18.

The effect of improved cleaning on patient-centred outcomes remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an environmental cleaning bundle to reduce health care-associated infections in hospitals. Methods: The REACH study was a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised trial done in 11 acute care hospitals in Australia. Eligible hospitals had an intensive care unit, were classified by the National Health Performance Authority as a major hospital (public hospitals) or having more than 200 inpatient beds (private hospitals), and had a health-care-associated infection surveillance programme. The stepped-wedge design meant intervention periods varied from 20 weeks to 50 weeks. We introduced the REACH cleaning bundle, a multimodal intervention, focusing on optimising product use, technique, staff training, auditing with feedback, and communication, for routine cleaning. The primary outcomes were incidences of health-care-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, Clostridium difficile infection, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci infection. The secondary outcome was the thoroughness of cleaning of frequent touch points, assessed by a fluorescent marking gel. This study is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, number ACTRN12615000325505. Findings: Between May 9, 2016, and July 30, 2017, we implemented the cleaning bundle in 11 hospitals. In the pre-intervention phase, there were 230 cases of vancomycin-resistant enterococci infection, 362 of S aureus bacteraemia, and 968 C difficile infections, for 3 534 439 occupied bed-days. During intervention, there were 50 cases of vancomycin-resistant enterococci infection, 109 of S aureus bacteraemia, and 278 C difficile infections, for 1 267 134 occupied bed-days. After the intervention, vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections reduced from 0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑35 to 0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑22 per 10 000 occupied bed-days (relative risk 0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑63, 95% CI 0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑41√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑97, p=0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑0340). The incidences of S aureus bacteraemia (0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑97 to 0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑80 per 10 000 occupied bed-days; 0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑82, 0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑60√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì1√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑12, p=0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑2180) and C difficile infections (2√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑34 to 2√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑52 per 10 000 occupied bed-days; 1√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑07, 0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑88√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì1√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑30, p=0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑4655) did not change significantly. The intervention increased the percentage of frequent touch points cleaned in bathrooms from 55% to 76% (odds ratio 2√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑07, 1√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑83√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì2√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑34, p<0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑0001) and bedrooms from 64% to 86% (1√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑87, 1√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑68√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì2√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑09, p<0√É‚Äö√Ç¬∑0001). Interpretation: The REACH cleaning bundle was successful at improving cleaning thoroughness and showed great promise in reducing vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections.

Williamson A.; Barker D.; Green S.; D'Este C.; Davies H.T.O.; Jorm L.; Shakeshaft A.; Rudge S.; Redman S.,Increasing the capacity of policy agencies to use research findings: A stepped-wedge trial,2019,"Background: This paper describes the trial of a novel intervention, Supporting Policy In health with evidence from Research: an Intervention Trial (SPIRIT). It examines (1) the feasibility of delivering this kind of programme in practice; (2) its acceptability to participants; (3) the impact of the programme on the capacity of policy agencies to engage with research; and (4) the engagement with and use of research by policy agencies. Methods: SPIRIT was a multifaceted, highly tailored, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised, trial involving six health policy agencies in Sydney, Australia. Agencies were randomly allocated to one of three start dates to receive the 1-year intervention programme. SPIRIT included audit, feedback and goal setting; a leadership programme; staff training; the opportunity to test systems to facilitate research use in policies; and exchange with researchers. Outcome measures were collected at each agency every 6 months for 30 months. Results: Participation in SPIRIT was associated with significant increases in research use capacity at staff and agency levels. Staff reported increased confidence in research use skills, and agency leaders reported more extensive systems and structures in place to support research use. Self-report data suggested there was also an increase in tactical research use among agency staff. Given the relatively small numbers of participating agencies and the complexity of their contexts, findings suggest it is possible to effect change in the way policy agencies approach the use of research. This is supported by the responses on the other trial measures; while these were not statistically significant, on 18 of the 20 different measures used, the changes observed were consistent with the hypothesised intervention effect (that is, positive impacts). Conclusions: As an early test of an innovative approach, SPIRIT has demonstrated that it is possible to increase research engagement and use in policy agencies. While more work is needed to establish the replicability and generalisability of these findings, this trial suggests that building staff skills and organisational structures may be effective in increasing evidence use. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2019 The Author(s).",10.1186/s12961-018-0408-8,Health,,,,Field experiment,A stepped-wedge design,6 agencies.,"The study did not show statistically significant results on most measures.

Evidence of the effectiveness of such on facilitating healthy food choices by school food service providers has not been reported. The primary aim of the study was to assess the impact of providing front-of-pack nutritional rating information on school canteen managers√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ likely food selections. Secondary outcomes were canteen manager awareness, attitudes and reported barriers to using the front-of-pack information. Methods A randomised controlled trial involving primary school canteen managers was conducted in a single region in New South Wales, Australia. Eligible participants were randomised to an intervention or control group and asked in a telephone interview which of 12 common food products sold in school canteens they would sell. Both groups received product name and brand information. The intervention group also received information regarding the nutritional rating of products. Results Canteen managers in the intervention group were significantly more likely than those in the control group to indicate they would sell three of the six √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√ã≈ìhealthier√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ products (p = 0.036, 0.005, 0.009). There was no difference between groups in the likelihood of making available for sale any of the six √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√ã≈ìless healthy√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ products. The majority of canteen managers who had heard of a product nutritional rating system agreed that it was helpful in identifying √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√ã≈ìhealthier√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ foods (88%, n = 31). Conclusions The inclusion of product nutritional rating information has the potential to improve the availability of some √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√ã≈ìhealthier√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ items on canteen menus and contribute to improving child dietary intake. Further research is required to determine whether the use of product nutritional rating information actually makes a difference to canteen manager choices. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2017",10.1016/j.appet.2017.11.103,Nutrition and exercise,,,,Field experiment,A regular RCT,_,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Methods A parallel eight cluster randomised controlled study was conducted in a major teaching hospital in Adelaide, Australia. Four wards were randomised to the intervention which comprised wearing a vest when administering medications; strategies for diverting interruptions; clinician and patient education; and reminders. Control wards were blinded to the intervention. Structured direct observations of medication administration processes were conducted. The primary outcome was non-medication-related interruptions during individual medication dose administrations. The secondary outcomes were total interruption and multitasking rates. A survey of nurses' experiences was administered. Results Over 8 weeks and 364.7hours, 227 nurses were observed administering 4781 medications. At baseline, nurses experienced 57 interruptions/100 administrations, 87.9% were unrelated to the medication task being observed. Intervention wards experienced a significant reduction in non-medication-related interruptions from 50/100 administrations (95% CI 45 to 55) to 34/100 (95% CI 30 to 38). Controlling for clustering, ward type and medication route showed a significant reduction of 15 non-medication-related interruptions/100 administrations compared with control wards. A total of 88 nurses (38.8%) completed the poststudy survey. Intervention ward nurses reported that vests were time consuming, cumbersome and hot. Only 48% indicated that they would support the intervention becoming hospital policy. Discussion Nurses experienced a high rate of interruptions. Few were related to the medication task, demonstrating considerable scope to reduce unnecessary interruptions. While the intervention was associated with a statistically significant decline in non-medication-related interruptions, the magnitude of this reduction and its likely impact on error rates should be considered, relative to the effectiveness of alternate interventions, associated costs, likely acceptability and long-term sustainability of such interventions. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Australia has adopted a novel Health Star Rating (HSR) system, but the legitimacy of this choice is unknown. Objective: To define the effects of different formats of front-of-pack labelling on the healthiness of food purchases and consumer perceptions. Design: Individuals were assigned at random to access one of four different formats of nutrition labelling√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨¬ùHSR, multiple traffic light labels (MTL), daily intake guides (DIG), recommendations/warnings (WARN)√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨¬ùor control (the nutrition information panel, NIP). Participants accessed nutrition information by using a smartphone application to scan the bar-codes of packaged foods, while shopping. The primary outcome was healthiness defined by the mean transformed nutrient profile score of packaged foods that were purchased over four weeks. Results: The 1578 participants, mean age 38 years, 84% female recorded purchases of 148,727 evaluable food items. The mean healthiness of the purchases in the HSR group was non-inferior to MTL, DIG, or WARN (all p < 0.001 at 2% non-inferiority margin). When compared to the NIP control, there was no difference in the mean healthiness of purchases for HSR, MTL, or DIG (all p > 0.07), but WARN resulted in healthier packaged food purchases (mean difference 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.72; p = 0.04). HSR was perceived by participants as more useful than DIG, and easier to understand than MTL or DIG (all p < 0.05). Participants also reported the HSR to be easier to understand, and the HSR and MTL to be more useful, than NIP (all p < 0.03). Conclusions: These real-world data align with experimental findings and provide support for the policy choice of HSR. Recommendation/warning labels warrant further exploration, as they may be a stronger driver of healthy food purchases. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2017 by the authors.

Fun 'n healthy in Moreland! aimed to improve child adiposity, school policies and environments, parent engagement, health behaviours and child wellbeing. Methods: All children from primary schools in an inner urban, culturally diverse and economically disadvantaged area in Victoria, Australia were eligible for participation. The intervention, fun 'n healthy in Moreland!, used a Health Promoting Schools Framework and provided schools with evidence, school research data and part time support from a Community Development Worker to develop health promoting strategies. Comparison schools continued as normal. Participants were not blinded to intervention status. The primary outcome was change in adiposity. Repeated cross-sectional design with nested longitudinal subsample. Results: Students from twenty-four primary schools (clusters) were randomised (aged 5-12 years at baseline). 1426 students from 12 intervention schools and 1539 students from 10 comparison schools consented to follow up measurements. Despite increased prevalence of healthy weight across all schools, after 3.5 years of intervention there was no statistically significant difference between trial arms in BMI z score post-intervention (Mean (sd): Intervention 0.68(1.16); Comparison: 0.72(1.12); Adjusted mean difference (AMD): -0.05, CI: -0.19 to 0.08, p = 0.44). Children from intervention schools consumed more daily fruit serves (AMD: 0.19, CI:0.00 to 0.37, p = 0.10), were more likely to have water (AOR: 1.71, CI:1.05 to 2.78, p = 0.03) and vegetables (AOR: 1.23, CI: 0.99 to 1.55, p = 0.07), and less likely to have fruit juice/cordial (AOR: 0.58, CI:0.36 to 0.93, p = 0.02) in school lunch compared to children in comparison schools. More intervention schools (8/11) had healthy eating and physical activity policies compared with comparison schools (2/9). Principals and schools highly valued the approach as a catalyst for broader positive school changes. The cost of the intervention per child was 65 per year. Conclusion: The fun n healthy in Moreland! intervention did not result in statistically significant differences in BMI z score across trial arms but did result in greater policy implementation, increased parent engagement and resources, improved child self-rated health, increased fruit, vegetable and water consumption, and reduction in sweet drinks. A longer-term follow up evaluation may be needed to demonstrate whether these changes are sustainable and impact on childhood overweight and obesity.

Trevena H.; Petersen K.; Thow A.M.; Dunford E.K.; Wu J.H.Y.; Neal B.,Effects of an advocacy trial on food industry salt reduction efforts√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨¬ùAn interim process evaluation,2017,"The decisions made by food companies are a potent factor shaping the nutritional quality of the food supply. A number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) advocate for corporate action to reduce salt levels in foods, but few data define the effectiveness of advocacy. This present report describes the process evaluation of an advocacy intervention delivered by one Australian NGO directly to food companies to reduce the salt content of processed foods. Food companies were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 22) or control (n = 23) groups. Intervention group companies were exposed to pre-planned and opportunistic communications, and control companies to background activities. Seven pre-defined interim outcome measures provided an indication of the effect of the intervention and were assessed using intention-to-treat analysis. These were supplemented by qualitative data from nine semi-structured interviews. The mean number of public communications supporting healthy food made by intervention companies was 1.5 versus 1.8 for control companies (p = 0.63). Other outcomes, including the mean number of news articles, comments and reports (1.2 vs. 1.4; p = 0.72), a published nutrition policy (23% vs. 44%; p = 0.21), public commitment to the Australian government√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s Food and Health Dialogue (FHD) (41% vs. 61%; p = 0.24), evidence of a salt reduction plan (23% vs. 30%; p = 0.56), and mean number of communications with the NGO (15 vs. 11; p = 0.28) were also not significantly different. Qualitative data indicated the advocacy trial had little effect. The absence of detectable effects of the advocacy intervention on the interim markers indicates there may be no impact of the NGO advocacy trial on the primary outcome of salt reduction in processed foods. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2017 by the authors.

The primary aim of the present study was to assess, relative to usual care, the effectiveness of a multi-strategy implementation intervention in improving childcare compliance with nutrition guidelines. As a secondary aim, the impact on child dietary intake was assessed. Design Parallel-group, randomised controlled trial design. The 6-month intervention was designed to overcome barriers to implementation of the nutrition guidelines that had been identified by applying the theoretical domains framework. Setting Hunter New England region, New South Wales, Australia. Subjects Forty-five centre-based childcare services. Results There were no differences between groups in the proportion of services providing food servings (per child) compliant with nutrition guideline recommendations for all five (5/5) food groups at follow-up (i.e. full compliance).

The TEXT ME study was a randomised clinical trial of people with CHD that were randomised into standard care or a text-message programme in addition to standard care. This analysis aimed to: 1) assess the effects of the intervention onadherence to the dietary guideline recommendations; 2) assess the consistency of effect across sub-groups; and 3) assess whether adherence to the dietary guideline recommendations mediated the improvements in objective clinical outcomes. Methods: Dietary data were collected using a self-report questionnaire to evaluate adherence to eight dietary guideline recommendations in Australia, including consumption of vegetables, fruits, fish, type of fat used for cooking and in spreads, takeaway food, salt and standard alcohol drinks. The primary outcome of this analysis was the proportion of patients adhering to √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬• 4 dietary guideline recommendations concomitantly and each recommendation was assessed individually as secondary outcomes. Data were analysed using log-binomial regression for categorical variables and analysis of covariance for continuous variables. Results: Among 710 patients, 54% were adhering to √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬• 4 dietary guideline recommendations (intervention 53% vs control 56%, p=0.376) at baseline. At six months, the intervention group had a significantly higher proportion of patients adhering to √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬• 4 recommendations (314, 93%) compared to the control group (264, 75%, RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.15-1.31, p<0.001). In addition, the intervention patients reported consuming higher amounts of vegetables, fruits, and fish per week; less takeaway foods per week; and greater salt intake control. The intervention had a similar effect in all sub-groups tested. There were significant mediational effects of the increase in adherence to the recommendations for the association between the intervention and LDL-cholesterol (p<0.001) and body mass index (BMI) at six months follow-up (p=0.005). Conclusion: A lifestyle-focused text-message programme improved adherence to the dietary guideline recommendations, and specifically improved self-reported consumption of vegetables, fruits, fish, takeaway foods and salt intake. Importantly, these improvements partially mediated improvements in LDL-cholesterol and BMI. This simple and scalable text-messaging intervention could be used as a strategy to improve diet in people with CHD. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2018 The Author(s).",10.1186/s12966-018-0677-1,Nutrition and exercise,,,,Field experiment,A regular RCT,710,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Fronek P.; Kendall M.B.,"The impact of Professional Boundaries for Health Professionals (PBHP) training on knowledge, comfort, experience, and ethical decision-making: a longitudinal randomized controlled trial",2017,"Purpose: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the impact of Professional Boundaries for Health Professionals (PBHP) training program on the knowledge, comfort, experience, and ethical decision-making of multidisciplinary practitioners facing client√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ìpractitioner boundary dilemmas. Methods: In all, 36 rehabilitation practitioners from an Australian state-wide spinal cord injuries service were assigned to experimental and control groups. The Boundaries in Practice (BIP) Scale measured outcomes at four points: pre, post, 3 months, and 1 year. The control group received the training after 3 months. Nonparametric Friedman√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s two-way analysis of variance was used to examine the trajectories over time. Results: Analysis was conducted using the data of 10 experimental and 13 control group participants who responded at four data collection points. The experimental group showed significant improvement in knowledge (√É¬è√¢‚Ç¨¬°2 = 10.673, p = 0.014) and comfort (√É¬è√¢‚Ç¨¬°2 = 9.727, p = 0.021) managing professional boundaries post-training. The control group showed no significant change in knowledge or comfort. No significant change was seen in experience across either experimental (√É¬è√¢‚Ç¨¬°2 = 3.609, p = 0.307) or control group (√É¬è√¢‚Ç¨¬°2 = 7.800, p = 0.050). Ethical decision-making improved in the control group (√É¬è√¢‚Ç¨¬°2 = 13.188, p = 0.004) following training, however remained unchanged in the experimental group. Conclusions: The findings do not definitively support this training approach. Ethical decision-making may improve more substantially within the practice context and organizational culture change. Multifaceted approaches are indicated. Implications for Rehabilitation Ethical dilemmas related to boundaries between clients and practitioners are a frequent occurrence in the rehabilitation setting. In a relatively small sample, the current randomized trial provided inconclusive evidence on the benefit of a 1-day needs-oriented training program to improve knowledge, comfort, and ethical decision-making. Randomized trials of education and training for rehabilitation practitioners are fraught with challenges in the clinical environment of the rehabilitation setting. Multifaceted training approaches, management support and training as well as changes to policy and organizational context in the rehabilitation setting may be needed to more holistically address the issues surrounding professional boundaries in the rehabilitation setting. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/09638288.2016.1236152,Health,,,,Field experiment,A regular RCT,36,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results in certain areas.

Online school-canteen ordering systems, where students order and pay for their lunch online, provide an avenue to improve healthy canteen purchases through the application of consumer-behavior strategies that have an impact on purchasing decisions. Objective: We assessed the efficacy of a consumer-behavior intervention implemented in an online school-canteen ordering system in reducing the energy, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium contents of primary student lunch orders. Design: A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted that involved 2714 students (aged 5-12 y) from 10 primary schools in New South Wales, Australia, who were currently using an online canteen ordering system. Schools were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the intervention (enhanced system) or the control (standard online ordering only). The intervention included consumer-behavior strategies that were integrated into the online ordering system (targeting menu labeling, healthy food availability, placement, and prompting). Results: Mean energy (difference: -567.25 kJ; 95% CI: -697.95, -436.55 kJ; P < 0.001), saturated fat (difference: -2.37 g; 95% CI: -3.08, -1.67 g; P < 0.001), and sodium (difference: -227.56 mg; 95% CI: -334.93, -120.19 mg; P < 0.001) contents per student lunch order were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group at follow-up. No significant differences were observed for sugar (difference: 1.16 g; 95% CI: -0.50, 2.83 g; P = 0.17). Conclusions: The study provides strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of a consumer-behavior intervention using an existing online canteen infrastructure to improve purchasing behavior from primary school canteens.

Porter J.; Haines T.P.; Truby H.,The efficacy of Protected Mealtimes in hospitalised patients: A stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial,2017,"Background: Protected Mealtimes is an intervention developed to address the problem of malnutrition in hospitalised patients through increasing positive interruptions (such as feeding assistance) whilst minimising unnecessary interruptions (including ward rounds and diagnostic procedures) during mealtimes. This clinical trial aimed to measure the effect of implementing Protected Mealtimes on the energy and protein intake of patients admitted to the subacute setting. Methods: A prospective, stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial was undertaken across three hospital sites at one health network in Melbourne, Australia. All patients, except those receiving end-of-life care or not receiving oral nutrition, admitted to these wards during the study period participated. The intervention was guided by the British Hospital Caterers Association reference policy on Protected Mealtimes and by principles of implementation science. Primary outcome measures were daily energy and protein intake. The study was powered to determine whether the intervention closed the daily energy deficit between estimated intake and energy requirements measured as 1900 kJ/day in the pilot study for this trial. Results: There were 149 unique participants, including 38 who crossed over from the control to intervention period as the Protected Mealtimes intervention was implemented. In total, 416 observations of 24-hour food intake were obtained. Energy intake was not significantly different between the intervention ([mean √É‚Äö√Ç¬± SD] 6479 √É‚Äö√Ç¬± 2486 kJ/day) and control (6532 √É‚Äö√Ç¬± 2328 kJ/day) conditions (p = 0.88). Daily protein intake was also not significantly different between the intervention (68.6 √É‚Äö√Ç¬± 26.0 g/day) and control (67.0 √É‚Äö√Ç¬± 25.2 g/day) conditions (p = 0.86). The differences between estimated energy/protein requirements and estimated energy/protein intakes were also limited between groups. The adjusted analysis yielded significant findings for energy deficit: (coefficient [robust 95% CI], p value) of -1405 (-2354 to -457), p = 0.004. Variability in implementation across aspects of Protected Mealtimes policy components was noted. Conclusions: The findings of this trial mirror the findings of other observational studies of Protected Mealtimes implementation where nutritional intakes were observed. Very few positive improvements to nutritional intake have been identified as a result of Protected Mealtimes implementation. Instead of this intervention, approaches with a greater level of evidence for improving nutritional outcomes, such as mealtime assistance, other food-based approaches and the use of oral nutrition support products to supplement oral diet, should be considered in the quest to reduce hospital malnutrition.

Internationally, research suggests that the majority of schools do not implement these policies. In New South Wales (NSW), Australia, the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy requires that school canteens prohibit the sale of 'red' foods (i.e. foods that are typically nutrient poor and high in energy, such as confectionary and deep-fried foods) and 'banned'drinks (i.e. soft drinks); and that the majority of items on the menu are 'green' (i.e. foods that are good sources of nutrients, such fruits, vegetables and lean meats). This study examined the impact of a multicomponent audit and feedback intervention on schools' implementation of the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy. A secondary aim was to assess the impact of the intervention on menu composition. Methods: This study was a parallel group randomised controlled trial with 72 rural and remote primary schools (36 interventions, 36 controls) located in one region within NSW, Australia. Intervention schools received an initial face to face contact and up to four cycles of audit and feedback (consisting of a menu audit, written feedback report and telephone feedback) over a 12-month period. The primary trial outcomes were the proportion of schools with a canteen menu that had: i) no 'red' foods or 'banned' drinks; and ii) >50% 'green' items, as assessed via standardised menu audits undertaken by trained dietitians. For each primary outcome, between-group differences were assessed using Fisher's exact test under an intention to treat approach. Results: There was insufficient evidence to conclude the intervention had a positive impact on the proportion of intervention schools with no 'red' or 'banned' items on their menu (RR = 2.8; 95% CI: 0.9 to 8.9; p = 0.0895), or on the proportion of intervention schools with more than 50% 'green' items (RR = 1.5; 95% CI: 0.7 to 3.2; p = 0.2568). These findings remained non-significant in the multiple imputation analyses. Intervention schools were significantly more likely to have a lower percentage of 'red' items (p-value: 0.007) and a higher percentage of 'green' items on the menu (p-value: 0.014). This remained statistically significant in the multiple imputation analyses for 'red items' (p-value: 0.0081) but not for 'green' items (p-value: 0.0910). Conclusions: While there was insufficient statistical evidence to suggest that this multicomponent audit and feedback intervention was effective in improving primary schools' compliance with a healthy canteen policy, the intervention demonstrated some positive impact in reducing the availability of 'red' items on the menu.

The aim of the trial was to assess the effectiveness of a multi-strategic intervention to increase implementation of a state-wide healthy canteen policy. The impact of the intervention on the energy, total fat, and sodium of children's canteen purchases and on schools' canteen revenue was also assessed. Methods: Australian primary schools with a canteen were randomised to receive a 12-14-month, multi-strategic intervention or to a no intervention control group. The intervention sought to increase implementation of a state-wide healthy canteen policy which required schools to remove unhealthy items (classified as 'red' or 'banned') from regular sale and encouraged schools to 'fill the menu' with healthy items (classified as 'green'). The intervention strategies included allocation of a support officer to assist with policy implementation, engagement of school principals and parent committees, consensus processes with canteen managers, training, provision of tools and resources, academic detailing, performance feedback, recognition and marketing initiatives. Data were collected at baseline (April to September, 2013) and at completion of the implementation period (November, 2014 to April, 2015). Results: Seventy schools participated in the trial. Relative to control, at follow-up, intervention schools were significantly more likely to have menus without 'red' or 'banned' items (RR=21.11; 95% CI 3.30 to 147.28; p√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬§0.01) and to have at least 50% of menu items classified as 'green' (RR=3.06; 95% CI 1.64 to 5.68; p√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬§0.01). At follow-up, student purchases from intervention school canteens were significantly lower in total fat (difference=-1.51g; 95% CI -2.84 to -0.18; p=0.028) compared to controls, but not in energy (difference=-132.32kJ; 95% CI -280.99 to 16.34; p=0.080) or sodium (difference=-46.81mg; 95% CI -96.97 to 3.35; p=0.067). Canteen revenue did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusion: Poor implementation of evidence-based school nutrition policies is a problem experienced by governments internationally, and one with significant implications for public health. The study makes an important contribution to the limited experimental evidence regarding strategies to improve implementation of school nutrition policies and suggests that, with multi-strategic support, implementation of healthy canteen policies can be achieved in most schools.

Design: Two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial. Methods: In 2011, children aged 4-13 years from thirteen primary/elementary schools (in Illawarra, New South Wales, Australia) were invited to participate in the study. School recruitment was based on existing policies, equipment and willingness to participate. Participating schools were randomly allocated to the intervention or control using the 'hat and draw' method. The intervention was delivered over four months. Intervention schools introduced policy changes and portable equipment to break-time after baseline measures were collected. The primary outcome was the proportion of break-time spent in Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) assessed by the System for Observing Playground Activity in Youth (SOPLAY). The analysis involved linear mixed models adjusting for the clustering effect of schools. The study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614001128684). Results: Four schools (two intervention and two control) met the inclusion criteria (1582 children: 790 males; 267 controls, total of 792 females; 248 controls). Students from the intervention schools had a greater increase at follow-up in the proportion of break-time in MVPA; (adjusted difference = 12.5 percentage points, 95% CI [-13.0%, 38.0%]; P = 0.17; r = 0.6) compared to the controls. MVPA at recess significantly increased (adjusted difference = 18.0 percentage points, 95% CI [6.9%, 29.1%]; P = 0.02; effect size = 0.7). There were no significant increases in MVPA when examining overall break times. Results were greater for girls compared to boys.

Despite this, research internationally and in Australia indicates that few schools implement such policies. This study aims to examine whether a theoretically designed, multi-strategy intervention was effective in increasing the implementation of a healthy canteen policy in Australian primary schools. Methods: A parallel group randomised controlled trial was conducted with all government and Catholic primary schools within one region in New South Wales, Australia who had an operational canteen that provided food to primary school aged children (5-12 years) and were not currently receiving an intervention to change their canteen practices. Schools randomised to the intervention arm received a 9-month multicomponent intervention including ongoing support, provision of resources, performance monitoring and feedback, executive support and recognition. The primary outcomes were the proportion of the schools with a canteen menu that: i) did not include 'red' or 'banned' items according to the healthy canteen policy; and ii) had more than 50 % 'green' items. The primary outcome was assessed via menu audit at baseline and follow up by dietitians blinded to group allocation. Results: Fifty-three eligible schools were randomised to either the intervention or control group (28 intervention; 25 control). Analyses with 51 schools who returned school menus found that intervention schools were significantly more likely relative to control schools to have a menu without 'red' or 'banned' items (RR = 5.78 (1.45-23.05); p = 0.002) and have at least 50 % of menu items classified as green (RR = 2.03 (1.01-4.08); p = 0.03). Conclusions: This study found that a multi-component intervention was effective in improving primary schools' compliance with a healthy canteen policy. Given the lack of evidence regarding how best to support schools with implementing evidence-based policies to improve child diet, this trial for the first time provides high quality evidence to practitioners and policy makers seeking to improve nutrition policy implementation in schools.

The 'Physical Activity 4 Everyone' (PA4E1) study tested a multi-component physical activity intervention in 10 secondary schools from socio-economically disadvantaged communities. This paper aimed to report the secondary outcomes of the study; to determine whether the intervention impacted on adiposity outcomes (weight, body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score), and whether any effect was moderated by sex, baseline BMI and baseline physical activity level, at 12 and 24 months.SUBJECTS/METHODS:A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. The school-based intervention included seven physical activity strategies targeting the following: curriculum (strategies to maximise physical activity in physical education, student physical activity plans, an enhanced school sport programme); school environment (physical activity during school breaks, modification of school policy); and parents and the community (parent engagement, links with community physical activity providers). Students' weight (kg), BMI and BMI z-score, were collected at baseline (Grade 7), 12 and 24 months. Linear Mixed Models were used to assess between-group mean difference from baseline to 12 and 24 months. Exploratory sub-analyses were undertaken according to three moderators of energy balance.RESULTS:A total of 1150 students (mean age=12 years) provided outcome data at baseline, 1051 (91%) at 12 months and 985 (86%) at 24 months. At 12 months, there were group-by-time effects for weight (mean difference=-0.90 kg (95% confidence interval (CI)=-1.50, -0.30), P<0.01) and BMI (-0.28 kg m -2 (-0.50, -0.06), P=0.01) in favour of the intervention group, but not for BMI z-score (-0.05 (-0.11; 0.01), P=0.13). These findings were consistent for weight (-0.62 kg (-1.21, 0.03), P=0.01) and BMI (-0.28 kg m -2 (-0.49, -0.06), P=0.01) at 24 months, with group-by-time effects also found for BMI z-score (-0.08 (-0.14; -0.02), P=0.02) favouring the intervention group.CONCLUSION:The PA4E1 school-based intervention achieved moderate reductions in adiposity among adolescents from socio-economically disadvantaged communities.

The aim of this paper is to report the 24-month effectiveness of a multicomponent school-based intervention (Physical Activity 4 Everyone) in reducing the decline in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among secondary school students in disadvantaged areas of New South Wales, Australia. Study design A cluster RCT was conducted in five intervention and five control schools with follow-up measures taken at 24 months post-randomization. Setting/participants The trial was undertaken within secondary schools located in disadvantaged communities in New South Wales, Australia. Intervention A multicomponent school-based intervention based on the Health Promoting Schools Framework was implemented. The intervention consisted of seven physical activity promotion strategies that targeted the curriculum (teaching strategies to increase physical activity in physical education lessons, student physical activity plans, and modification of school sport program); school environment (recess/lunchtime activities, school physical activity policy); parents (parent newsletters); and community (community physical activity provider promotion). Six additional strategies supported school implementation of the physical activity intervention strategies. Main outcome measure Minutes per day spent in MVPA, objectively measured by accelerometer. Results Participants (N=1,150, 49% male) were a cohort of students aged 12 years (Grade 7) at baseline (March√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJune 2012) and 14 years (Grade 9) at follow-up (March√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJuly 2014). At 24-month follow-up, there were significant effects in favor of the intervention group for daily minutes of MVPA. The adjusted mean difference in change in daily MVPA between groups was 7.0 minutes (95% CI=2.7, 11.4, p<0.002) (analysis conducted December 2014√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFebruary 2015). Sensitivity analyses based on multiple imputation were consistent with the main analysis (6.0 minutes, 95% CI=0.6, 11.3, p<0.031). Conclusions The intervention was effective in increasing adolescents√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ minutes of MVPA, suggesting that implementation of the intervention by disadvantaged schools has the potential to slow the decline in physical activity.

The initiative is an environmental cleaning bundle, with five interdependent, evidence-based components (training, technique, product, audit and communication) implemented with environmental services staff to enhance hospital cleaning practices. Methods/design: The REACH study will use a stepped-wedge randomised controlled design to test the study intervention, an environmental cleaning bundle, in 11 Australian hospitals. All trial hospitals will receive the intervention and act as their own control, with analysis undertaken of the change within each hospital based on data collected in the control and intervention periods. Each site will be randomised to one of the 11 intervention timings with staggered commencement dates in 2016 and an intervention period between 20 and 50 weeks. All sites complete the trial at the same time in 2017. The inclusion criteria allow for a purposive sample of both public and private hospitals that have higher-risk patient populations for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The primary outcome (objective one) is the monthly number of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemias (SABs), Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) infections, per 10,000 bed days. Secondary outcomes for objective one include the thoroughness of hospital cleaning assessed using fluorescent marker technology, the bio-burden of frequent touch surfaces post cleaning and changes in staff knowledge and attitudes about environmental cleaning. A cost-effectiveness analysis will determine the second key outcome (objective two): the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from implementation of the cleaning bundle. The study uses the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (iPARIHS) framework to support the tailored implementation of the environmental cleaning bundle in each hospital. Discussion: Evidence from the REACH trial will contribute to future policy and practice guidelines about hospital environmental cleaning. It will be used by healthcare leaders and clinicians to inform decision-making and implementation of best-practice infection prevention strategies to reduce HAIs in hospitals.

The aim of the break in play is to motivate the player to modify or cease gambling so the activity remains within affordable levels. The aim of this study was to investigate whether imposed breaks in play in the absence of accompanying warning messages were effective in reducing cravings. Participants (141 university students) were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: 15 min computer simulated Black Jack play followed by no break, a 3 or 8 min break in play. Participants were administered a battery of measures to assess problem gambling card play, cravings, and dissociation to assess the effects of length of break on cravings. Results indicated that cravings increased rather than decreased with imposed breaks in play, and that the strength of cravings were higher following the eight- compared to 3-min break. It was concluded that breaks in play in isolation might produce counterproductive, unintended, and even perverse effects. The policy implications for responsible gambling strategies is that breaks in play ought to be accompanied with warning and/or personal appraisal messages if optimal effects in reducing within session gambling expenditure are to be achieved. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.",10.1007/s10899-015-9565-7,Other,,,,Field experiment,Regular RCT,141,"The study indicated that cravings increased rather than decreased with imposed breaks in play, and the strength of cravings was higher following the eight-minute break compared to the",,,,,Jul 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,141,"The study showed that cravings increased rather than decreased with imposed breaks in play, and the strength of cravings was higher following the eight-minute break compared to the",Gambling; Mental health
Trevena H.; Thow A.M.; Dunford E.; Wu J.H.Y.; Neal B.,Protocol for a cluster-randomised trial to determine the effects of advocacy actions on the salt content of processed foods,2016,"Background: Corporate decisions affecting the composition of processed foods are a potent factor shaping the nutritional quality of the food supply. The addition of large quantities of salt to foods is incompatible with Australian Dietary Guidelines and the reformulation of processed foods to have less salt is a focus of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). There is evidence that advocacy can influence corporate behaviour but there are few data to define the effects of NGOs working in the food space. The aim of this study is to quantify the effects of advocacy delivered by a local NGO on the salt content of food products produced or marketed by companies in Australia. Methods/Design: This is a cluster-randomised controlled trial that will be done in Australia from 2013 to 2015 which includes 45 food companies. The 23 companies in the control group will receive no specific intervention whilst the 22 companies in the intervention group will receive an advocacy program based upon an established theory of change model. The primary outcome will be the mean change in sodium content (mg/100 g) of processed foods produced or marketed by intervention compared to control companies assessed at 24 months. Interim outcomes (statements of support, published nutrition policies, level of engagement, knowledge and use of technology to reduce salt, salt reduction plans, and support for national initiatives) will also be assessed and a qualitative evaluation will provide more detailed insight. Discussion: This novel study will provide robust randomised evidence about the effects of advocacy on food company behaviour and the quality of the processed food supply. A finding of improved food company behaviour will highlight the potential for greater investment in advocacy whilst the opposite result will reinforce the importance of government-led initiatives for the improvement of the food supply.

However, robust evidence of the cost-effectiveness of pricing manipulations on dietary behaviour is limited. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a 20% price reduction on fruits and vegetables and a combined skills-based behaviour change and price reduction intervention. Design and methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective was undertaken for the randomized controlled trial Supermarket Healthy Eating for Life (SHELf). Female shoppers in Melbourne, Australia were randomized to: (1) skill-building (n = 160); (2) price reductions (n = 161); (3) combined skill-building and price reduction (n = 161); or (4) control group (n = 161). The intervention was implemented for three months followed by a six month follow-up. Costs were measured in 2012 Australian dollars. Fruit and vegetable purchasing and consumption were measured in grams/week. Results: At three months, compared to control participants, price reduction participants increased vegetable purchases by 233 g/week (95% CI 4 to 462, p = 0.046) and fruit purchases by 364 g/week (95% CI 95 to 633, p = 0.008). Participants in the combined group purchased 280 g/week more fruits (95% CI 27 to 533, p = 0.03) than participants in the control group. Increases were not maintained six-month post intervention. No effect was noticed in the skill-building group. Compared to the control group, the price reduction intervention cost an additional A$2.3 per increased serving of vegetables purchased per week or an additional A$3 per increased serving of fruit purchased per week. The combined intervention cost an additional A$12 per increased serving of fruit purchased per week compared to the control group. Conclusions: A 20% discount on fruits and vegetables was effective in promoting overall fruit and vegetable purchases during the period the discount was active and may be cost-effective.

Yoong S.L.; Jones J.; Marshall J.; Wiggers J.; Seward K.; Finch M.; Fielding A.; Wolfenden L.,A theory-based evaluation of a dissemination intervention to improve childcare cooks' intentions to implement nutritional guidelines on their menus,2016,"Background: Childcare services represent a key setting to implement nutritional interventions to support the development of healthy eating behaviours in young children. Childcare-specific nutritional guidelines outlining recommendations for provision of food in care have been developed. Despite this, research suggests that few childcare services currently implement these guidelines. This study aimed to examine the impact of providing printed educational materials on childcare service cooks' intentions to use nutritional guidelines and provide fruit and vegetables on their menu. Findings: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 77 childcare services (38 control and 39 intervention). Intervention service cooks were mailed a two-page educational material together with a menu planning checklist. Intervention development and evaluation was guided by the theory of planned behaviour. Outcome data assessing intentions to use nutritional guidelines and serves of fruit and vegetables provided on menus (primary outcomes) as well as secondary outcomes (attitudes, behavioural regulation and social norms) were collected via a telephone interview with cooks. Relative to the comparison group, cooks in the intervention arm had significantly higher intentions to use the guidelines (p value 0.0005), accompanied by significant changes in perceived behavioural control (p value 0.0008) and attitudes (p value 0.0071). No significant difference in serves of fruit (p value 0.7278) and vegetables (p value 0.0573) was observed. Conclusions: The use of educational materials can improve childcare service cooks' intentions to use nutritional guidelines; however, as a standalone strategy, it may not improve provision of food on menus. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2016 Yoong et al.",10.1186/s13012-016-0474-7,Nutrition and exercise,,,,Field experiment,A regular RCT,77,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Methods The study employed a cluster randomised controlled trial design that allocated clubs either an alcohol accreditation intervention or a control condition. Club representatives completed a scripted telephone survey at baseline and again √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√Ç¬º3 years following. Demographic information about clubs was collected along with information about club income. Results Number of players and senior teams were not significantly different between treatment groups following the intervention. The intervention group, however, showed a significantly higher mean number of spectators. Estimates of annual club income between groups at follow-up showed no significant difference in revenue. Conclusions This study found no evidence to suggest that efforts to reduce alcohol-related harm in community sporting clubs will compromise club revenue and membership. So what? These findings suggest that implementation of an intervention to improve alcohol management of sporting clubs may not have the unintended consequence of harming club viability. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© Australian Health Promotion Association 2016.",10.1071/HE15124,Drugs and alcohol,,,,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,The sample size is not given.,"The study did not show statistically significant results in terms of the number of players and senior teams between the treatment groups following the intervention.

Methods Australian-registered physiotherapists were electronically randomized into intervention and control groups. The intervention group accessed RAP-eL over 4 weeks. Change in self-reported confidence in knowledge and skills was compared between groups at the end of the RCT using linear regression conditioned for baseline scores by a blinded assessor, using intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included physiotherapists' satisfaction with RA management and responses to RA-relevant clinical statements and practice-relevant vignettes. Retention was evaluated in a cohort study 8 weeks after the RCT. Results Eighty physiotherapists were randomized into the intervention and 79 into the control groups. Fifty-six and 48, respectively, provided baseline data. Significant between-group differences were observed for change in confidence in knowledge (mean difference 8.51; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 6.29, 10.73; effect size 1.62) and skills (mean difference 7.26; 95% CI 5.1, 9.4; effect size 1.54), with the intervention group performing better. Satisfaction in ability to manage RA, 4 of the 6 clinical statements, and responses to vignettes demonstrated significant improvement in the intervention group. Although 8-week scores showed declines in most outcomes, their clinical significance remains uncertain. Conclusion RAP-eL can improve self-reported confidence, likely practice behaviors and satisfaction in physiotherapists' ability to manage people with RA, and improve their clinical knowledge in several areas of best-practice RA management in the short term. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2015, American College of Rheumatology.",10.1002/acr.22535,Health,,,,Field experiment,Regular RCT,Eighty physiotherapists were randomized into the intervention group and 79 into,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

The study also sought to determine if the intervention was effective in improving child dietary intake and increasing child physical activity levels while attending childcare. Methods: A parallel group, randomised controlled trial was conducted in a sample of 128 childcare services. Intervention strategies included provision of implementation support staff, securing executive support, staff training, consensus processes, academic detailing visits, tools and resources, performance monitoring and feedback and a communications strategy. The primary outcome of the trial was the proportion of services implementing all seven healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices targeted by the intervention. Outcome data were collected via telephone surveys with nominated supervisors and room leaders at baseline and immediately post-intervention. Secondary trial outcomes included the differences between groups in the number of serves consumed by children for each food group within the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and in the proportion of children engaged in sedentary, walking or very active physical activity assessed via observation in a random subsample of 36 services at follow-up. Results: There was no significant difference between groups for the primary trial outcome (p = 0.44). Relative to the control group, a significantly larger proportion of intervention group services reported having a written nutrition and physical activity policy (p = 0.05) and providing adult-guided activities to develop fundamental movement skills (p = 0.01). There were no significant differences between groups at follow-up on measures of child dietary intake or physical activity. Conclusions: The findings of the trial were equivocal. While there was no significant difference between groups for the primary trial outcome, the intervention did significantly increase the proportion of intervention group services implementing two of the seven healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices. High levels of implementation of a number of policies and practices at baseline, significant obesity prevention activity in the study region and higher than previously reported intra-class correlation of child behaviours may, in part, explain the trial findings.

Kingsland M.; Wolfenden L.; Tindall J.; Rowland B.; Sidey M.; Mcelduff P.; Wiggers J.H.,Improving the implementation of responsible alcohol management practices by community sporting clubs: A randomised controlled trial,2015,"Introduction and Aims: Despite an increased prevalence of risky alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm among members of sporting groups and at sporting venues, sporting clubs frequently fail to implement alcohol management practices consistent with liquor legislation and best practice guidelines. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a multi-strategy intervention in improving the implementation of responsible alcohol management practices by sports clubs. Design and Methods: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 87 football clubs, with half randomised to receive a multi-strategy intervention to support clubs to implement responsible alcohol management practices. The 2-year intervention, which was based on implementation and capacity building theory and frameworks, included project officer support, funding, accreditation rewards, printed resources, observational audit feedback, newsletters, training and support from state sporting organisations. Interviews were undertaken with club presidents at baseline and post-intervention to assess alcohol management practice implementation. Results: Post-intervention, 88% of intervention clubs reported implementing '13 or more' of 16 responsible alcohol management practices, which was significantly greater than the proportion of control groups reporting this level of implementation (65%) [odds ratio: 3.7 (95% confidence interval: 1.1-13.2); P=0.04]. All intervention components were considered highly useful and three-quarters or more of clubs rated the amount of implementation support to be sufficient. Discussion and Conclusions: The multi-strategy intervention was successful in improving alcohol management practices in community sports clubs. Further research is required to better understand implementation barriers and to assess the long-term sustainability of the change in club alcohol management practices.

Abdel-Latif M.E.; Boswell D.; Broom M.; Smith J.; Davis D.,Parental presence on neonatal intensive care unit clinical bedside rounds: Randomised trial and focus group discussion,2015,"Background There are limited data to inform the choice between parental presence at clinical bedside rounds (PPCBR) and non-PPCBR in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Methods We performed a single-centre, survey-based, crossed-over randomised trial involving parents of all infants who were admitted to NICU and anticipated to stay >11 days. Parents were randomly assigned using a computer-generated stratified block randomisation protocol to start with PPCBR or non-PPCBR and then crossed over to the other arm after a wash-out period. At the conclusion of each arm, parents completed the 'NICU Parental Stressor Scale ' (a validated tool) and a satisfaction survey. After completion of the trial, we surveyed all healthcare providers who participated at least in one PPCBR rounding episode. We also offered all participating parents and healthcare providers the opportunity to partake in a focus group discussion regarding PPCBR. Results A total of 72 parents were enrolled in this study, with 63 parents (87%) partially or fully completing the trial. Of the parents who completed the trial, 95% agreed that parents should be allowed to attend clinical bedside rounds. A total of 39 healthcare providers ' surveys were returned and 35 (90%) agreed that parents should be allowed to attend rounds. Nine healthcare providers and 8 parents participated in an interview or focus group, augmenting our understanding of the ways in which PPCBR was beneficial. Conclusions Parents and healthcare providers strongly support PPCBR. NICUs should develop policies allowing PPCBR while mitigating the downsides and concerns of parents and healthcare providers such as decreased education opportunity and confi dentiality concerns.

Dodd J.M.,Dietary and lifestyle advice for pregnant women who are overweight or obese: The LIMIT Randomized Trial,2014,"Overweight and obesity during pregnancy are common and are associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes for both the mother and the infant. However, robust evidence about the effect of antenatal dietary and lifestyle interventions on health outcomes is lacking. We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial, recruiting 2,212 women (from 3 public maternity hospitals across South Australia) with a singleton pregnancy between 10+0 and 20+0 weeks' gestation and a BMI √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬•25. The women were randomized to lifestyle advice (n = 1,108) or standard care (n = 1,104). Women randomized to lifestyle advice participated in a comprehensive dietary and lifestyle intervention over the course of their pregnancy (delivered by research staff), while women randomized to standard care received pregnancy care according to local guidelines, which did not include such information. Provision of the lifestyle intervention was associated with a significant 18% relative risk reduction in the chance of infants being born with a birth weight above 4 kg. No other significant differences were identified in maternal pregnancy and birth outcomes between the two treatment groups. Observational studies highlight the association between a high infant birth weight and the subsequent risk of childhood and adulthood obesity. Antenatal interventions that are effective in reducing high infant birth weights therefore represent a significant strategy to tackle obesity from a population health perspective, while ongoing interrogation of the biospecimens and measurements, including ongoing childhood follow-up, will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the mechanistic pathways of maternal-to-infant/childhood obesity. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2014 S.

Lombard C.B.; Harrison C.L.; Kozica S.L.; Zoungas S.; Keating C.; Teede H.J.,Effectiveness and implementation of an obesity prevention intervention: The HeLP-her Rural cluster randomised controlled trial,2014,"Background: To impact on the obesity epidemic, interventions that prevent weight gain across populations are urgently needed. However, even the most efficacious interventions will have little impact on obesity prevention unless they are successfully implemented in diverse populations and settings. Implementation research takes isolated efficacy studies into practice and policy and is particularly important in obesity prevention where there is an urgent need to accelerate the evidence to practice cycle. Despite the recognised need, few obesity prevention interventions have been implemented in real life settings and to our knowledge rarely target rural communities. Methods. Here we describe the rationale, design and implementation of a Healthy Lifestyle Program for women living in small rural communities (HeLP-her Rural). The primary goal of HeLP-her Rural is to prevent weight gain using a low intensity, self-management intervention. Six hundred women from 42 small rural communities in Australia will be randomised as clusters (n-21 control towns and n = 21 intervention towns). A pragmatic randomised controlled trial methodology will test efficacy and a comprehensive mixed methods community evaluation and cost analysis will inform effectiveness and implementation of this novel prevention program. Discussion. Implementing population interventions to prevent obesity is complex, costly and challenging. To address these barriers, evidence based interventions need to move beyond isolated efficacy trials and report outcomes related to effectiveness and implementation. Large pragmatic trials provide an opportunity to inform both effectiveness and implementation leading to potential for greater impact at the population level. Pragmatic trials should incorporate both effectiveness and implementation outcomes and a multidimensional methodology to inform scale-up to population level. The learnings from this trial will impact on the design and implementation of population obesity prevention strategies nationally and internationally. Trial registration.

Sakashita C.; Jan S.; Senserrick T.; Lo S.; Ivers R.,Perceived Value of a Motorcycle Training Program: The Influence of Crash History and Experience of the Training,2014,"Objective: Evidence that rider training reduces motorcycle-related injuries or crashes is currently lacking. However, significant community demand for training persists, which in turn can influence policy. The present study aims to contribute to the understanding of this demand via two objectives: to (1) offer a method, namely, contingent valuation, to measure the value motorcyclists place on training and (2) examine determinants of such value. Methods: Value was elicited through a willingness to question, using a bidding format, novice motorcyclists who were randomly assigned to groups either offered the training or not. Results: The group that was offered and subsequently received training provided a lower mean perceived value of the training than the group that was not. Perceived value increased with rider age and decreased with training participation and near-crash experiences, controlling for bidding order, income, education, and experience of other training. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the utility of contingent valuation in quantifying the perceived value of training, as well as the modifiability of perceived value, with age, training participation, and near-crash experiences as key determinants. This indicates that research to determine ways to align the perceived value with evidence on training effectiveness is worthwhile in order to facilitate more appropriate and justified allocation of road safety resources. Potential options to explore and evaluate may include community education on evidence of training effectiveness as well as alternative measures with demonstrated effectiveness in reducing crash risks. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/15389588.2013.828346,Health,,,,Field experiment,A regular RCT,_,The study did not explicitly mention statistically significant results in the provided abstract.

Shakeshaft A.; Doran C.; Petrie D.; Breen C.; Havard A.; Abudeen A.; Harwood E.; Clifford A.; D'Este C.; Gilmour S.; Sanson-Fisher R.,The Effectiveness of Community Action in Reducing Risky Alcohol Consumption and Harm: A Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial,2014,"Background:The World Health Organization, governments, and communities agree that community action is likely to reduce risky alcohol consumption and harm. Despite this agreement, there is little rigorous evidence that community action is effective: of the six randomised trials of community action published to date, all were US-based and focused on young people (rather than the whole community), and their outcomes were limited to self-report or alcohol purchase attempts. The objective of this study was to conduct the first non-US randomised controlled trial (RCT) of community action to quantify the effectiveness of this approach in reducing risky alcohol consumption and harms measured using both self-report and routinely collected data.Methods and Findings:We conducted a cluster RCT comprising 20 communities in Australia that had populations of 5,000-20,000, were at least 100 km from an urban centre (population √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬• 100,000), and were not involved in another community alcohol project. Communities were pair-matched, and one member of each pair was randomly allocated to the experimental group. Thirteen interventions were implemented in the experimental communities from 2005 to 2009: community engagement; general practitioner training in alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI); feedback to key stakeholders; media campaign; workplace policies/practices training; school-based intervention; general practitioner feedback on their prescribing of alcohol medications; community pharmacy-based SBI; web-based SBI; Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services support for SBI; Good Sports program for sports clubs; identifying and targeting high-risk weekends; and hospital emergency department-based SBI. Primary outcomes based on routinely collected data were alcohol-related crime, traffic crashes, and hospital inpatient admissions. Routinely collected data for the entire study period (2001-2009) were obtained in 2010. Secondary outcomes based on pre- and post-intervention surveys (n = 2,977 and 2,255, respectively) were the following: long-term risky drinking, short-term high-risk drinking, short-term risky drinking, weekly consumption, hazardous/harmful alcohol use, and experience of alcohol harm. At the 5% level of statistical significance, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the interventions were effective in the experimental, relative to control, communities for alcohol-related crime, traffic crashes, and hospital inpatient admissions, and for rates of risky alcohol consumption and hazardous/harmful alcohol use. Although respondents in the experimental communities reported statistically significantly lower average weekly consumption (1.90 fewer standard drinks per week, 95% CI = -3.37 to -0.43, p = 0.01) and less alcohol-related verbal abuse (odds ratio = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.96, p = 0.04) post-intervention, the low survey response rates (40% and 24% for the pre- and post-intervention surveys, respectively) require conservative interpretation. The main limitations of this study are as follows: (1) that the study may have been under-powered to detect differences in routinely collected data outcomes as statistically significant, and (2) the low survey response rates.Conclusions:This RCT provides little evidence that community action significantly reduces risky alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms, other than potential reductions in self-reported average weekly consumption and experience of alcohol-related verbal abuse. Complementary legislative action may be required to more effectively reduce alcohol harms.Trial registration:Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12607000123448 Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2014 Shakeshaft et al.",10.1371/journal.pmed.1001617,Drugs and alcohol,,,,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,20 communities,"The study did not show statistically significant results for the primary outcomes of alcohol-related crime, traffic crashes, and hospital inpatient admissions, nor for rates of risky",,,,,Jul 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,"2,977 (pre-intervention survey) and 2,255 (",The study showed statistically significant results for two outcomes: respondents in the experimental communities reported a statistically significant lower average weekly alcohol consumption (1.90 fewer standard,Health; Drugs and alcohol; Justice; Transport

A community jury allows presentation of complex information and may clarify how participants view screening after being well-informed. We examined whether participating in a community jury had an effect on men's knowledge about and their intention to participate in PSA screening. Design: Random allocation to either a 2-day community jury or a control group, with preassessment, postassessment and 3-month follow-up assessment. Setting: Participants from the Gold Coast (Australia) recruited via radio, newspaper and community meetings. Participants: Twenty-six men aged 50-70 years with no previous diagnosis of prostate cancer. Intervention: The control group (n=14) received factsheets on PSA screening. Community jury participants (n=12) received the same factsheets and further information about screening for prostate cancer. In addition, three experts presented information on PSA screening: a neutral scientific advisor provided background information, one expert emphasised the potential benefits of screening and another expert emphasised the potential harms. Participants discussed information, asked questions to the experts and deliberated on personal and policy decisions. Main outcome and measures: Our primary outcome was change in individual intention to have a PSA screening test. We also assessed knowledge about screening for prostate cancer. Results: Analyses were conducted using intention-totreat. Immediately after the jury, the community jury group had less intention-to-screen for prostate cancer than men in the control group (effect size=-0.6 SD, p=0.05). This was sustained at 3-month follow-up. Community jury men also correctly identified PSA test accuracy and considered themselves more informed (effect size=1.2 SD, p<0.001).

Navarro H.J.; Shakeshaft A.; Doran C.M.; Petrie D.J.,"Does increasing community and liquor licensees' awareness, police activity, and feedback reduce alcohol-related violent crime? A benefit-cost analysis",2013,"Approximately half of all alcohol-related crime is violent crime associated with heavy episodic drinking. Multi-component interventions are highly acceptable to communities and may be effective in reducing alcohol-related crime generally, but their impact on alcohol-related violent crime has not been examined. This study evaluated the impact and benefit-cost of a multi-component intervention (increasing community and liquor licensees' awareness, police activity, and feedback) on crimes typically associated with alcohol-related violence. The intervention was tailored to weekends identified as historically problematic in 10 experimental communities in NSW, Australia, relative to 10 control ones. There was no effect on alcohol-related assaults and a small, but statistically significant and cost-beneficial, effect on alcohol-related sexual assaults: a 64% reduction in in the experimental relative to control communities, equivalent to five fewer alcohol-related sexual assaults, with a net social benefit estimated as AUD$3,938,218. The positive benefit-cost ratio was primarily a function of the value that communities placed on reducing alcohol-related harm: the intervention would need to be more than twice as effective for its economic benefits to be comparable to its costs. It is most likely that greater reductions in crimes associated with alcohol-related violence would be achieved by a combination of complementary legislative and community-based interventions. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",10.3390/ijerph10115490,Drugs and alcohol,,,,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,20 communities,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Participants were required to rate their assigned pack on measures of brand appeal and purchase intentions. Results: Plain packaging was associated with significantly reduced smoker ratings of 'positive pack characteristics ' (p<0.001), 'positive smoker characteristics' (p=0.003) and 'positive taste characteristics' (p=0.033) in the Winfield brand name condition only. Across the four pack conditions, no main differences were found for 'negative smoker characteristics' (p=0.427) or 'negative harm characteristics' (p=0.411). In comparison to plain packaging, the presentation of branded packaging was associated with higher odds of smokers' purchase intentions (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.54; p=0.002).

Finch M.; Wolfenden L.; Morgan P.J.; Freund M.; Jones J.; Wiggers J.,"A cluster randomized trial of a multi-level intervention, delivered by service staff, to increase physical activity of children attending center-based childcare",2014,"Objective: To evaluate the impact of a multi-level intervention on the physical activity levels of 3-5. year old children attending center-based childcare services. Method: The trial was conducted in New South Wales Australia in 2010 in 20 centers with 459 children. The intervention, included: fundamental movement skill sessions; structured activities; staff role modelling; limiting small screen recreation and sedentary time; and anactivity promoting physical environment. Control services continued with usual routines. Physical activity during care was assessed using pedometers at baseline and at six months after baseline. Intervention implementation was assessed via observation of staff physical activity practices and audits of service environment and policy. Results: Mean step counts at baseline and follow-up were 17.20 (CI 15.94-18.46) and 16.12 (CI 14.86-17.30) in the intervention group and 13.78 (CI 12.76-14.80) and 13.87 (CI 12.57-15.17) in the control group (p. =0.12). Intervention services showed significantly greater increases in the total minutes that teachers led structured activities, relative to control group services (p. =0.02).

Design: A 2 √É∆í√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù 2 √É∆í√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù 5 between-subjects Web-based experiment. Parents were randomly shown an advertisement (counter-advertisement challenging FOPP/control advertisement) and then a pair of food products from the same category: an unhealthy product featuring an FOPP (nutrient content claim/sports celebrity endorsement) and a healthier control product with no FOPP. Setting: Australia. Participants: A total of 1,269 Australian-based parents of children aged 5-12 years recruited from an online panel. Main Outcome Measures: Parents nominated which product they would prefer to buy and which they thought was healthier, then rated the unhealthy product and FOPP on various characteristics. Analysis: Differences between advertisement conditions were assessed using logistic regression (product choice tasks) and analysis of variance tests (ratings of unhealthy product and FOPP). Results: Compared with parents who saw a control advertisement, parents who saw a counter-advertisement perceived unhealthy products featuring FOPPs as less healthy, expressed weaker intentions for buying such products, and were more likely to read the nutrition facts panel before nominating choices (all P < .001). Conclusions and Implications: Counter-advertising may help reduce the misleading influence of unhealthy food marketing and improve the accuracy of parents' evaluations of how nutritious promoted food products are. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2014 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.",10.1016/j.jneb.2014.05.008,Nutrition and exercise,,,,Survey experiment,A regular RCT,1269,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Implementing initiatives promoting healthy eating and physical activity in childcare settings has been identified as a priority to prevent excessive child weight gain. Despite this, few trials have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of interventions to support population-wide implementation of such initiatives. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention in increasing the implementation of healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices by centre-based childcare services. Methods and analysis: The study will employ a parallel group randomised controlled trial design. A sample of 128 childcare services in the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia, will be recruited to participate in the trial. 64 services will be randomly allocated to a 12-month implementation intervention. The remaining 64 services will be allocated to a usual care control group. The intervention will consist of a number of strategies to facilitate childcare service implementation of healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices. Intervention strategies will include implementation support staff, securing executive support, consensus processes, staff training, academic detailing visits, performance monitoring and feedback, tools and resources, and a communications strategy. The primary outcome of the trial will be the prevalence of services implementing all healthy eating and physical activity policies and practices targeted by the intervention. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, telephone surveys with nominated supervisors and room leaders of childcare services will be conducted at baseline and immediately postintervention. Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee and the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee. Study findings will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

Parker E.J.; Misan G.; Chong A.; Mills H.; Roberts-Thomson K.; Horowitz A.M.; Jamieson L.M.,An oral health literacy intervention for Indigenous adults in a rural setting in Australia,2012,"Background: Indigenous Australians suffer substantially poorer oral health than their non-Indigenous counterparts and new approaches are needed to address these disparities. Previous work in Port Augusta, South Australia, a regional town with a large Indigenous community, revealed associations between low oral health literacy scores and self-reported oral health outcomes. This study aims to determine if implementation of a functional, context-specific oral health literacy intervention improves oral health literacy-related outcomes measured by use of dental services, and assessment of oral health knowledge, oral health self-care and oral health- related self-efficacy. Methods/design: This is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that utilises a delayed intervention design. Participants are Indigenous adults, aged 18 years and older, who plan to reside in Port Augusta or a nearby community for the next two years. The intervention group will receive the intervention from the outset of the study while the control group will be offered the intervention 12 months following their enrolment in the study. The intervention consists of a series of five culturally sensitive, oral health education workshops delivered over a 12 month period by Indigenous project officers. Workshops consist of presentations, hands-on activities, interactive displays, group discussions and role plays. The themes addressed in the workshops are underpinned by oral health literacy concepts, and incorporate oral health-related self-efficacy, oral health-related fatalism, oral health knowledge, access to dental care and rights and entitlements as a patient. Data will be collected through a self-report questionnaire at baseline, at 12 months and at 24 months. The primary outcome measure is oral health literacy. Secondary outcome measures include oral health knowledge, oral health self-care, use of dental services, oral health-related self-efficacy and oral health-related fatalism. Discussion: This study uses a functional, context-specific oral health literacy intervention to improve oral health literacy-related outcomes amongst rural-dwelling Indigenous adults. Outcomes of this study will have implications for policy and planning by providing evidence for the effectiveness of such interventions as well as provide a model for working with Indigenous communities. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2012 Parker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1471-2458-12-461,Health,,,,Field experiment,A regular RCT,_,"The provided description does not include specific results or indicate whether the study showed statistically significant results.

Conducted from 2008 to 2010, the program had high uptake and retention and showed positive impacts on some dietary outcomes and television viewing. Funding was secured for a follow-up study of participants two and 3.5. years post intervention (at child ages ~. 3.5 and 5. years). The follow-up study aims to assess intervention effects, mediators and moderators of effects, and program cost-effectiveness over the longer term. Methods/design: The 492 families still enrolled in the Melbourne InFANT Program at intervention conclusion will be recontacted and renewed consent sought to participate in this follow-up study. No further intervention will occur. Home visit data collections will occur approximately two and 3.5. years post intervention. Main outcomes to be assessed include child body mass index, waist circumference, diet (3 √É∆í√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù 24-hour recalls; food frequency questionnaire), physical activity (8 days ActiGraph accelerometer data; parent reported active play) and sedentary time (8 days ActiGraph accelerometer and ActivPAL inclinometer data; parent reported screen time). Discussion: Follow-up of participants of the Melbourne InFANT Program at two and 3.5. years post intervention will allow assessment of longer term intervention effects, investigation of potential mediators and moderators of such effects, and economic evaluation of the longer term outcomes. This information will be valuable to researchers and policy makers in progressing the field of early childhood obesity prevention. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2012 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.cct.2012.10.008,Nutrition and exercise,,,,Field experiment,Regular RCT,492,The abstract does not provide specific information on whether the study showed statistically significant results.

Design: Randomized trial of the PJS method in parallel with the current accreditation survey (CAS) method of the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS). Setting: Acute healthcare organizations in Australia. Participants: Seventeen organizations, 28 organizational staff, nine surveyors and 38 patients. Main Outcome Measures: The results of each surveying method were compared. Participants provided feedback, via 18 interviews and 40 questionnaire surveys, about the benefits and disadvantages of a PJS compared to a CAS. Results: The PJS method is not as comprehensive as the CAS method for accreditation assessment. In matched assessments the majority of items were rated lower by the PJS method than by the CAS. PJSs were shown to be appropriate for assessing mandatory clinical criteria, but were less effective for assessing corporate and support criteria. The two methods diverged in their final assessments of which organizations met the accreditation threshold. Participants endorsed the use of PJSs within accreditation processes. Conclusions: The PJS methodology complements but is not a substitute for existing accreditation methods. There is significant stakeholder support for the inclusion of the PJS method within the current accreditation programme. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© The Author 2012.

Whilst the antiviral drug oseltamivir (a neuraminidase inhibitor) is approved for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza during outbreaks, there have been no trials comparing treatment only (T) versus treatment and prophylaxis (T&P) in Aged Care Facilities (ACFs). Our objective was to compare a policy of T versus T&P for influenza outbreaks in ACFs. Methods and Findings: We performed a cluster randomised controlled trial in 16 ACFs, that followed a policy of either ""T""-oseltamivir treatment (75 mg twice a day for 5 days)-or ""T&P""-treatment and prophylaxis (75 mg once a day for 10 days) for influenza outbreaks over three years, in addition to enhanced surveillance. The primary outcome measure was the attack rate of influenza. Secondary outcomes measures were deaths, hospitalisation, pneumonia and adverse events. Laboratory testing was performed to identify the viral cause of influenza-like illness (ILI) outbreaks. The study period 30 June 2006 to 23 December 2008 included three southern hemisphere winters. During that time, influenza was confirmed as the cause of nine of the 23 ILI outbreaks that occurred amongst the 16 ACFs. The policy of T&P resulted in a significant reduction in the influenza attack rate amongst residents: 93/255 (36%) in residents in T facilities versus 91/397 (23%) in T&P facilities (p = 0.002). We observed a non-significant reduction in staff: 46/216 (21%) in T facilities versus 47/350 (13%) in T&P facilities (p = 0.5). There was a significant reduction in mean duration of outbreaks (T = 24 days, T&P = 11 days, p = 0.04). Deaths, hospitalisations and pneumonia were non-significantly reduced in the T&P allocated facilities. Drug adverse events were common but tolerated. Conclusion: Our trial lacked power but these results provide some support for a policy of ""treatment and prophylaxis"" with oseltamivir in controlling influenza outbreaks in ACFs.

Jorm A.F.; Kitchener B.A.; Sawyer M.G.; Scales H.; Cvetkovski S.,Mental health first aid training for high school teachers: A cluster randomized trial,2010,"Background: Mental disorders often have their first onset during adolescence. For this reason, high school teachers are in a good position to provide initial assistance to students who are developing mental health problems. To improve the skills of teachers in this area, a Mental Health First Aid training course was modified to be suitable for high school teachers and evaluated in a cluster randomized trial.Methods: The trial was carried out with teachers in South Australian high schools. Teachers at 7 schools received training and those at another 7 were wait-listed for future training. The effects of the training on teachers were evaluated using questionnaires pre- and post-training and at 6 months follow-up. The questionnaires assessed mental health knowledge, stigmatizing attitudes, confidence in providing help to others, help actually provided, school policy and procedures, and teacher mental health. The indirect effects on students were evaluated using questionnaires at pre-training and at follow-up which assessed any mental health help and information received from school staff, and also the mental health of the student.Results: The training increased teachers' knowledge, changed beliefs about treatment to be more like those of mental health professionals, reduced some aspects of stigma, and increased confidence in providing help to students and colleagues. There was an indirect effect on students, who reported receiving more mental health information from school staff. Most of the changes found were sustained 6 months after training. However, no effects were found on teachers' individual support towards students with mental health problems or on student mental health.Conclusions: Mental Health First Aid training has positive effects on teachers' mental health knowledge, attitudes, confidence and some aspects of their behaviour.Trial registration: ACTRN12608000561381. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2010 Jorm et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1471-244X-10-51,Education,,,,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,_,"The study showed statistically significant results in several areas.

Czech S.; Shakeshaft A.P.; Breen C.; Sanson-Fisher R.W.,Whole-of-community approaches to reducing alcohol-related harm: What do communities think?,2010,"Aim: A whole-of-community approach can be defined as a range of intervention strategies simultaneously implemented across a whole community. One possibility for the lack of evidence for the effectiveness of this type of approach to reducing alcohol-related harm is that whole-of-community strategies to date have not examined whether this type of approach, relative to alternative strategies, is acceptable to communities. Methods: The acceptability of a whole-of-community approach and a range of uni-dimensional strategies are examined using 3,017 survey responses from a random sample of 7,985 individuals (aged 18-62) across 20 rural communities in NSW, Australia, as part of a large-scale randomised controlled trial: the Alcohol Action in Rural Communities (AARC) project. Using the Australian Electoral Roll, the sample was selected to reflect specific characteristics (i.e., gender and age) of each participating town as defined in the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2001 census. Results: Relative to other commonly implemented intervention strategies, the whole-of-community approach acceptability rating (85.5%) was statistically significantly greater than increased random breath testing (80.7%), pharmacist information (76.2%) and workplace training (77.0%), and less than increased pub/club compliance (95.8%), high-school programs (96.2%), increased police enforcement (89.5%) and hospital-based advice (88.6%). Intervention acceptability ratings were not associated with exposure to the suggested intervention with two exceptions: those exposed to pub/club compliance provided a lower acceptability rating, while those exposed to workplace training/policies provided a higher acceptability rating. Conclusions: The high level of public support for alcohol interventions and the relatively low exposure to such interventions suggest scope for increasing awareness of intervention activity in communities and implementing a coherent whole-of-community approach. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2010 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/s10389-010-0339-5,Drugs and alcohol,,,,Survey experiment,A clustered RCT,3017,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Davis E.; Williamson L.; MacKinnon A.; Cook K.; Waters E.; Herrman H.; Sims M.; Mihalopoulos C.; Harrison L.; Marshall B.,Building the capacity of family day care educators to promote children's social and emotional wellbeing: An exploratory cluster randomised controlled trial,2011,"Background: Childhood mental health problems are highly prevalent, experienced by one in five children living in socioeconomically disadvantaged families. Although childcare settings, including family day care are ideal to promote children's social and emotional wellbeing at a population level in a sustainable way, family day care educators receive limited training in promoting children's mental health. This study is an exploratory wait-list control cluster randomised controlled trial to test the appropriateness, acceptability, cost, and effectiveness of ""Thrive,"" an intervention program to build the capacity of family day care educators to promote children's social and emotional wellbeing. Thrive aims to increase educators' knowledge, confidence and skills in promoting children's social and emotional wellbeing. Methods/Design. This study involves one family day care organisation based in a low socioeconomic area of Melbourne. All family day care educators (term used for registered carers who provide care for children for financial reimbursement in the carers own home) are eligible to participate in the study. The clusters for randomisation will be the fieldworkers (n = 5) who each supervise 10-15 educators. The intervention group (field workers and educators) will participate in a variety of intervention activities over 12 months, including workshops; activity exchanges with other educators; and focused discussion about children's social and emotional wellbeing during field worker visits. The control group will continue with their normal work practice. The intervention will be delivered to the intervention group and then to the control group after a time delay of 15 months post intervention commencement. A baseline survey will be conducted with all consenting educators and field workers (n = √É¬¢√ã‚Ä†√Ç¬º70) assessing outcomes at the cluster and individual level. The survey will also be administered at one month, six months and 12 months post-intervention commencement. The survey consists of questions measuring perceived levels of knowledge, confidence and skills in promoting children's social and emotional wellbeing. As much of this intervention will be delivered by field workers, field worker-family day care educator relationships are key to its success and thus supervisor support will also be measured. All educators will also have an in-home quality of care assessment at baseline, one month, six months and 12 months post-intervention commencement. Process evaluation will occur at one month, six months and 12 months post-intervention commencement. Information regarding intervention fidelity and economics will also be assessed in the survey. Discussion. A capacity building intervention in child mental health promotion for family day care is an essential contribution to research, policy and practice. This initiative is the first internationally, and essential in building an evidence base of interventions in this extremely policy-timely setting.

Design: Randomised controlled trial nested within a baseline cross sectional survey of body mass index (BMI). Randomisation and outcomes measurement, but not participants, were blinded to group assignment. Setting: 45 family practices (66 general practitioners) in Melbourne, Australia. Participants: 3958 children visiting their general practitioner in May 2005-July 2006 were surveyed for BMI. Of these, 258 children aged 5 years 0 months up to their 10th birthday who were overweight or obese by International Obesity Taskforce criteria were randomised to intervention (n=139) or control (n=119) groups. Children who were very obese (UK BMI z score √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬•3.0) were excluded. Intervention: Four standard consultations over 12 weeks targeting change in nutrition, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour, supported by purpose designed family materials. Main outcomes measures: Primary measure was BMI at 6 and 12 months after randomisation. Secondary measures were mean activity count/min by 7-day accelerometry, nutrition score from 4-day abbreviated food frequency diary, and child health related quality of life. Differences were adjusted for socioeconomic status, age, sex, and baseline BMI. Results: Of 781 eligible children, 258 (33%) entered the trial; attrition was 3.1% at 6 months and 6.2% at 12 months. Adjusted mean differences (intervention - control) at 6 and 12 months were, for BMI, -0.12 (95% CI -0.40 to 0.15, P=0.4) and -0.11 (-0.45 to 0.22, P=0.5); for physical activity in counts/min, 24 (-4 to 52, P=0.09) and 11 (-26 to 49, P=0.6); and, for nutrition score, 0.2 (-0.03 to 0.4, P=0.1) and 0.1 (-0.1 to 0.4, P=0.2). There was no evidence of harm to the child. Costs to the healthcare system were significantly higher in the intervention arm. Conclusions: Primary care screening followed by brief counselling did not improve BMI, physical activity, or nutrition in overweight or mildly obese 5-10 year olds, and it would be very costly if universally implemented.

White E.; Winstanley J.,"A randomised controlled trial of clinical supervision: Selected findings from a novel Australian attempt to establish the evidence base for causal relationships with quality of care and patient outcomes, as an informed contribution to mental health nursing practice development",2010,"This paper reports on selected findings from a novel randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in mental health settings in Queensland, Australia. Several national and state reports recently revealed the sub-optimal state of Australian mental health service provision which have direct implications for mental health nursing, including the privately experienced cost of working and coping in these settings. Clinical supervision (CS), a structured staff support arrangement, has shown promise as a positive contribution to the clinical practice development agenda and is now found reflected in health policy themes elsewhere in the world. However, CS is underdeveloped in Australia and the empirical evidence base for the informed implementation of CS, per se, has remained elusive. Within the overall context of a RCT design, therefore, and supplemented by other data collection methods, this large and generously funded study attempted to make an incremental contribution to better understanding this demanding substantive domain. Whilst the substantive insights and theoretical propositions reported here were derived from, and may be limited by, a sub-specialty of nursing and a single geographic location, they were earthed in the personal self-reported experience of those directly involved with a clinical practice innovation. They may resonate with counterparts beyond mental health nursing and Queensland, Australia, respectively, therefore, and may assist in both conceptualising and operationalising CS research, education, management, policy and clinical practice development decision making in the future. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© The Author(s), 2010.",10.1177/1744987109357816,Health,,,,Field experiment,Regular RCT,_,"The provided description does not specify whether the study showed statistically significant results or what those results were.

Costs for pharmaceuticals prescribed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) were obtained retrospectively at 12 months. Sociodemographic data and health-related quality-of-life (QoL) were recorded from questionnaires. Clinical measures (including body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, high and low density lipoprotein (LDL), and HbA1c) were also collected. Results: Mean pharmaceutical costs for DM patients (AU$4119) was greater than CVD patients (AU$2424). The largest contributor to costs in both groups was pharmaceuticals used for management of conditions other than CVD or DM. QoL (EQ5D) and BMI were significant predictors of costs in both groups. A history of cardiac events, HbA1c, age, and unemployment were significant predictors of costs in the DM group. A diagnosis of heart failure, frequency of hospital admissions, and LDL levels were significant predictors of costs in the CVD group. Roughly one third of total variation of costs can be explained by the regressors in both models. Limitations: Generalizability will be limited as data was derived from a trial and the study was not powered for this post-hoc analysis. Missing data imputation and self-reporting bias may also impact on results. Conclusions: Factors such as QoL BMI, HbA1c levels, and a history of cardiac events are significant predictors of costs. The results suggest there may be a place for interventions that improve quality-of-life and concurrently reduce pharmaceutical costs in patients with CVD or DM. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2011 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.",10.3111/13696998.2011.614304,Health,,,,Field experiment,A regular RCT,260,"The study did show statistically significant results.

Waters E.; Armstrong R.; Swinburn B.; Moore L.; Dobbins M.; Anderson L.; Petticrew M.; Clark R.; Conning R.; Moodie M.; Carter R.,An exploratory cluster randomised controlled trial of knowledge translation strategies to support evidence-informed decision-making in local governments (The KT4LG study),2011,"Background: Childhood overweight and obesity is the most prevalent and, arguably, politically complex child health problem internationally. Governments, communities and industry have important roles to play, and are increasingly expected to deliver an evidence-informed system-wide prevention program. However, efforts are impeded by a lack of organisational access to and use of research evidence. This study aims to identify feasible, acceptable and ideally, effective knowledge translation (KT) strategies to increase evidence-informed decision-making in local governments, within the context of childhood obesity prevention as a national policy priority. Methods/Design. This paper describes the methods for KT4LG, a cluster randomised controlled trial which is exploratory in nature, given the limited evidence base and methodological advances. KT4LG aims to examine a program of KT strategies to increase the use of research evidence in informing public health decisions in local governments. KT4LG will also assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. The intervention program comprises a facilitated program of evidence awareness, access to tailored research evidence, critical appraisal skills development, networking and evidence summaries and will be compared to provision of evidence summaries alone in the control program. 28 local governments were randomised to intervention or control, using computer generated numbers, stratified by budget tertile (high, medium or low). Questionnaires will be used to measure impact, costs, and outcomes, and key informant interviews will be used to examine processes, feasibility, and experiences. Policy tracer studies will be included to examine impact of intervention on policies within relevant government policy documents. Discussion. Knowledge translation intervention studies with a focus on public health and prevention are very few in number. Thus, this study will provide essential data on the experience of program implementation and evaluation of a system-integrated intervention program employed within the local government public health context. Standardised programs of system, organisational and individual KT strategies have not been described or rigorously evaluated. As such, the findings will make a significant contribution to understanding whether a facilitated program of KT strategies hold promise for facilitating evidence-informed public health decision making within complex multisectoral government organisations. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2011 Waters et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1471-2458-11-34,Health,,,,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,28,The provided description is an abstract of a study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial (KT4LG study) aimed at evaluating knowledge translation strategies to,,,,,Jul 24 Scopus,,,,This is a protocol/pre-analysis plan.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,28 local governments,"The description provided is an abstract of a study protocol, not the results of the study.

Study,2011,"Background: Physical activity (PA) is associated with positive cardio-metabolic health and emerging evidence suggests sedentary behavior (SB) may be detrimental to children's health independent of PA. The primary aim of the Transform-Us! study is to determine whether an 18-month, behavioral and environmental intervention in the school and family settings results in higher levels of PA and lower rates of SB among 8-9 year old children compared with usual practice (post-intervention and 12-months follow-up). The secondary aims are to determine the independent and combined effects of PA and SB on children's cardio-metabolic health risk factors; identify the factors that mediate the success of the intervention; and determine whether the intervention is cost-effective. Methods/design. A four-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 2 √É∆í√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù 2 factorial design, with schools as the unit of randomization. Twenty schools will be allocated to one of four intervention groups, sedentary behavior (SB-I), physical activity (PA-I), combined SB and PA (SB+PA-I) or current practice control (C), which will be evaluated among approximately 600 children aged 8-9 years in school year 3 living in Melbourne, Australia. All children in year 3 at intervention schools in 2010 (8-9 years) will receive the intervention over an 18-month period with a maintenance 'booster' delivered in 2012 and children at all schools will be invited to participate in the evaluation assessments. To maximize the sample and to capture new students arriving at intervention and control schools, recruitment will be on-going up to the post-intervention time point. Primary outcomes are time spent sitting and in PA assessed via accelerometers and inclinometers and survey. Discussion. To our knowledge, Transform-Us! is the first RCT to examine the effectiveness of intervention strategies for reducing children's overall sedentary time, promoting PA and optimizing health outcomes. The integration of consistent strategies and messages to children from teachers and parents in both school and family settings is a critical component of this study, and if shown to be effective, may have a significant impact on educational policies as well as on pedagogical and parenting practices. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2011Salmon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1471-2458-11-759,Nutrition and exercise,,,,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,600,"The provided description does not include specific results or indicate whether the study showed statistically significant results.

Shawyer F.; Meadows G.N.; Judd F.; Martin P.R.; Segal Z.; Piterman L.,The DARE study of relapse prevention in depression: Design for a phase 1/2 translational randomised controlled trial involving mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and supported self monitoring,2012,"Background: Depression is a common condition that typically has a relapsing course. Effective interventions targeting relapse have the potential to dramatically reduce the point prevalence of the condition. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a group-based intervention that has shown efficacy in reducing depressive relapse. While trials of MBCT to date have met the core requirements of phase 1 translational research, there is a need now to move to phase 2 translational research - the application of MBCT within real-world settings with a view to informing policy and clinical practice. The aim of this trial is to examine the clinical impact and health economics of MBCT under real-world conditions and where efforts have been made to assess for and prevent resentful demoralization among the control group. Secondary aims of the project involve extending the phase 1 agenda to an examination of the effects of co-morbidity and mechanisms of action.Methods/Design: This study is designed as a prospective, multi-site, single-blind, randomised controlled trial using a group comparison design between involving the intervention, MBCT, and a self-monitoring comparison condition, Depression Relapse Active Monitoring (DRAM). Follow-up is over 2 years. The design of the study indicates recruitment from primary and secondary care of 204 participants who have a history of 3 or more episodes of Major Depression but who are currently well. Measures assessing depressive relapse/recurrence, time to first clinical intervention, treatment expectancy and a range of secondary outcomes and process variables are included. A health economics evaluation will be undertaken to assess the incremental cost of MBCT.Discussion: The results of this trial, including an examination of clinical, functional and health economic outcomes, will be used to assess the role that this treatment approach may have in recommendations for treatment of depression in Australia and elsewhere. If the findings are positive, we expect that this research will consolidate the evidence base to guide the decision to fund MBCT and to seek to promote its availability to those who have experienced at least 3 episodes of depression.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12607000166471. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2012 Shawyer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1471-244X-12-3,Health,,,,Field experiment,It is a regular RCT.,204,The provided description is an abstract of a study design for a phase 1/2 translational randomized controlled trial involving mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT,,,,,Jul 24 Scopus,,,,This is a protocol/pre-analysis plan.,Something else,"Prospective, multi-site, single-blind, randomised controlled trial (",204,"The description provided is a study design for a trial and does not include the results of the study.

Couzos S.; Lea T.; Murray R.; Culbong M.,'We are not just participants - We are in charge': The NACCHO ear trial and the process for aboriginal community-controlled health research,2005,"Objective. Methodological criteria that characterise ethically sound community-based studies are often described in overviews but are rarely documented in clinical studies. Research investigating the health of Aboriginal Australians is often small-scale, descriptive and largely driven by non-Indigenous people. The 'community-controlled' model of research relating to Aboriginal peoples health is a form of 'participatory' research that shifts the balance of control towards those being researched. This paper describes the methodological issues and principles that underpin community-controlled health research; their practical application; and encourages their adoption in research involving Indigenous populations. Design. Descriptive report of the methods used to conduct the landmark Aboriginal community-controlled multi-centre double-blind randomised controlled clinical ear trial investigating ototopical treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media. Results. The characteristics of the community-controlled research model are illustrated under the headings of: setting the research agenda; research project planning and approval; conduct of research; and analysis, dissemination and application of findings. Conclusion. The 22 methodological elements which defined the community-controlled design of the ear trial may assist community groups, external research bodies and funding agencies to improve the acceptability, quality and scope of research involving Indigenous peoples. Aboriginal community-controlled organisations are well placed to lead research, which can be interventional and of a high scientific standard without compromising the values and principles of those being researched. With over 120 Aboriginal community-controlled health services (ACCHSs) across Australia, the potential exists for these services to engage in multi-centre research to realise solutions to health problems faced by Indigenous Australians. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",10.1080/13557850500071038,Health,,,,Report of an RCT,A regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The provided description does not include specific information about the statistical significance of the results or the detailed outcomes of the study.

Henry R.L.; Gibson P.G.; Vimpani G.V.; Francis J.L.; Hazell J.,Randomized controlled trial of a teacher-led asthma education program,2004,"Our objective was to determine whether an asthma education program in schools would have 1) a direct impact on student knowledge and attitudes to asthma and quality of life of the students with asthma, 2) an indirect impact on teacher knowledge and attitudes to asthma and on school policies about asthma, and 3) a sustainable program after the resources to implement the research were withdrawn. Seventeen intervention and 15 control schools participated in a controlled trial. Baseline knowledge and attitudes were measured in year 8 students (ages 13-14 years) and their teachers together with quality of life in the students with asthma. A three-lesson package about asthma was delivered by teachers as part of the Personal Development/Health/ Physical Education (PD/H/PE) curriculum. Follow-up questionnaires were administered to students and staff. Efforts to change school policies were documented. Five years after the intervention, PD/H/PE teachers were contacted to determine whether the program was still operating. Main outcome measures included asthma knowledge, attitudes, and quality of life. Questionnaires were returned by 4,161/4,475 of the year 8 students at baseline and by 3,443 at follow-up. In intervention schools, compared with control schools, students showed improved asthma knowledge (P<0.0001), improvement in tolerance to asthma (P=0.02), internal control (P=0.03), and less tendency to believe in the role of chance in asthma control (P=0.04). Students from intervention but not control schools showed significant improvements in overall quality of life (P=0.003 vs. P=0.82, respectively). Teachers from intervention schools showed significant increases in knowledge compared to control schools (P<0.0001). Intervention schools were more likely to seek further health education about asthma (P<0.01). Five years after the 35 schools involved in the development of the materials or the trial had been offered the Living With Asthma package, 25 (71 %) were still teaching the program to most or all of their students. Fifty-nine of the 61 (97%) high schools in the Hunter Region now have the program. Management and distribution of the Living With Asthma program have been taken over by the Asthma Foundation of New South Wales. The package has been updated and is being offered to all high schools throughout New South Wales as part of the National Asthma-Friendly Schools Project. In conclusion, a teacher-led asthma education program in secondary school had direct and indirect beneficial outcomes and was sustained at a high level for 5 years in most schools in the Hunter Region, despite minimal ongoing maintenance and support from health workers. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",10.1002/ppul.20095,Health,,,,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,"4,161 students at baseline and 3,443 at follow-up.","Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Wake M.; Gold L.; McCallum Z.; Gerner B.; Waters E.,Economic Evaluation of a Primary Care Trial to Reduce Weight Gain in Overweight/Obese Children: The LEAP Trial,2008,"Background: A common policy response to the childhood obesity epidemic is to recommend that primary care physicians screen for and offer counseling to the overweight/obese. As the literature suggests, this approach may be ineffective; it is important to document the opportunity costs incurred by brief primary care obesity interventions that ultimately may not alter body mass index (BMI) trajectory. Methods: Live, Eat and Play (LEAP) was a randomized controlled trial of a brief secondary prevention intervention delivered by family physicians in 2002-2003 that targeted overweight/mildly obese children aged 5 to 9 years. Primary care utilization was prospectively audited via medical records, and parents reported family resource use by written questionnaire. Outcome measures were BMI (primary) and parent-reported physical activity and dietary habits (secondary) in intervention compared with control children. Results: The cost of LEAP per intervention family was AU $4094 greater than for control families, mainly due to increased family resources devoted to child physical activity. Total health sector costs were AU $873 per intervention family and AU $64 per control, a difference of AU $809 (P < .001). At 15 months, intervention children did not differ significantly in adjusted BMI or daily physical activity scores compared with the control group, but dietary habits had improved. Conclusions: This brief intervention resulted in higher costs to families and the health care sector, which could have been devoted to other uses that do create benefits to health and/or family well-being. This has implications for countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, whose current guidelines recommend routine surveillance and counseling for high child BMI in the primary care sector. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2008 Academic Pediatric Association.",10.1016/j.ambp.2008.06.006,Nutrition and exercise,,,,Field experiment,It is a regular RCT.,The sample size is not given.,The study did not show statistically significant results in terms of adjusted BMI or daily physical activity scores between the intervention and control groups at 15 months.

Hamilton G.; Cross D.; Resnicow K.; Hall M.,A school-based harm minimization smoking intervention trial: Outcome results,2005,"Aims: To determine the impact of a school-based harm minimization smoking intervention compared to traditional abstinence-based approaches. Design, setting and participants: A school-based cluster randomized trial was conducted in Perth, Western Australia in 30 government high schools from 1999 to 2000. Over 4000 students were recruited to participate and schools were assigned randomly to either the harm minimization intervention or a standard abstinence-based programme. Intervention: The harm minimization intervention comprised eight 1-hour lessons over 2 years, quitting support from school nurses and enactment of policies to support programme components. Comparison schools implemented standard abstinence-based programmes and policies. Measures: Cigarette smoking was categorized at two levels: regular smoking, defined as smoking on 4 or more days in the previous week; and 30-day smoking as any smoking within the previous month. Findings: At immediate post-test (20 months post-baseline), after accounting for baseline differences, school-level clustering effects, socio-economic status, gender and family smoking, intervention students were less likely to smoke regularly [OR = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.36, 0.71] or to have smoked within the previous 30 days (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.53, 0.91).

Bammer G.; Ritter A.; Kutin J.J.; Lintzeris N.,Fast-tracking implementation through trial design: The case of buprenorphine treatment in Victoria,2009,"Objectives: We investigated how a randomised controlled trial (RCT) could be designed to incorporate features known or thought likely to enhance the uptake of the new treatment into clinical practice post-trial. Method and Results: Between 1999 and 2001, we trialled buprenorphine treatment for heroin dependence in community settings throughout Victoria, using 28 experienced methadone prescribers and 34 pharmacists across 19 sites. In this case study, we describe how we incorporated seven features considered important in treatment uptake: skilled and experienced practitioners, government and policy support, incentives to prescribe the new treatment, specialist support services, clinical guidelines, training programs and patient involvement and information. We also present information showing that uptake of buprenorphine treatment was substantially boosted in Victoria compared with other Australian jurisdictions immediately after the trial in 2001 and that this increase was sustained until at least 2006. Conclusion: While we cannot prove that our trial design was responsible for the increased uptake of buprenorphine treatment in Victoria, we do show that design has been a neglected aspect of clinical trials in terms of enhancing post-trial uptake of the treatment being tested. Implications: Those interested in closing the 'know-do' gap between research and practice may wish to further explore this very promising lead. Imaginative linking of features known to enhance treatment uptake to pressing research questions may lead to new information on efficacy, as well as getting valuable drugs into the treatment system more rapidly. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2009 The Authors.

Petrie D.; Doran C.; Shakeshaft A.; Sanson-Fisher R.,The relationship between alcohol consumption and self-reported health status using the EQ5D: Evidence from rural Australia,2008,"Alcohol misuse represents one of the leading causes of preventable death, illness and injury in Australia. Extensive research exists estimating the effect of risky alcohol use on mortality, but little research quantifies the impact of risky alcohol consumption on morbidity. Such estimates are required to more precisely measure the benefit of interventions aimed at reducing risky alcohol use. Ordered probit and tobit models are used in this research to analyse the impact of risky drinking on self-reported health status using questionnaire data from an age and gender stratified sample drawn from 20 rural communities in New South Wales which are part of a large randomised controlled trial of community based alcohol interventions. It is found that risky alcohol use is associated with lower self-reported health; however, the average effect is small apart for those drinking at very-high risk. The effect of alcohol on morbidity, derived from the current analyses, is lower than that commonly used in current economics analyses. If this is accurate for geographical regions other than rural Australia, then from a policy viewpoint, these economic analyses may tend to overemphasise interventions which are morbidity reducing, such as taxation, and place undue focus on alcohol as a risk factor and consequently adversely impact resource allocation decisions. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Service coordinators and the behavioral and care-planning approach were new. The health status (SF-36) in six of eight projects improved, and those patients who had been hospitalized in the year immediately preceding the trial were the most likely to save on costs.

Wakefield M.A.; Germain D.; Durkin S.J.,How does increasingly plainer cigarette packaging influence adult smokers' perceptions about brand image? An experimental study,2008,"Background: Cigarette packaging is a key marketing strategy for promoting brand image. Plain packaging has been proposed to limit brand image, but tobacco companies would resist removal of branding design elements. Method: A 3 (brand types) √É∆í√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù 4 (degree of plain packaging) between-subject experimental design was used, using an internet online method, to expose 813 adult Australian smokers to one randomly selected cigarette pack, after which respondents completed ratings of the pack. Results: Compared with current cigarette packs with full branding, cigarette packs that displayed progressively fewer branding design elements were perceived increasingly unfavourably in terms of smokers' appraisals of the packs, the smokers who might smoke such packs, and the inferred experience of smoking a cigarette from these packs. For example, cardboard brown packs with the number of enclosed cigarettes displayed on the front of the pack and featuring only the brand name in small standard font at the bottom of the pack face were rated as significantly less attractive and popular than original branded packs. Smokers of these plain packs were rated as significantly less trendy/stylish, less sociable/outgoing and less mature than smokers of the original pack. Compared with original packs, smokers inferred that cigarettes from these plain packs would be less rich in tobacco, less satisfying and of lower quality tobacco.

Design: School based cluster randomised controlled trial. Students were surveyed using laptop computers, twice in the first year of intervention and annually thereafter for a further two years. Setting: Secondary schools. Participants: 2678 year 8 students (74%) participated in the first wave of data collection. Attrition across the waves was less than 3%, 8%, and 10% respectively with no differential response rate between intervention and control groups at the subsequent waves (98% v 96%; 92% v 92%, and 90% v 89% respectively). Main results: A comparatively consistent 3% to 5% risk difference was found between intervention and control students for any drinking, any and regular smoking, and friends' alcohol and tobacco use across the three waves of follow up.

Wen L.M.; Baur L.A.; Rissel C.; Wardle K.; Alperstein G.; Simpson J.M.,Early intervention of multiple home visits to prevent childhood obesity in a disadvantaged population: A home-based randomised controlled trial (Healthy Beginnings Trial),2007,"Background. Studies have shown that a proportion of children as young as two years are already overweight. This indicates that obesity prevention programs that commence as early as possible and are family-focused are needed. This Healthy Beginnings Trial aims to determine the efficacy of a community-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a home visiting intervention in preventing the early onset of childhood overweight and obesity. The intervention will be conducted over the first two years of life to increase healthy feeding behaviours and physical activity, decrease physical inactivity, enhance parent-child interaction, and hence reduce overweight and obesity among children at 2 and 5 years of age in the most socially and economically disadvantaged areas of Sydney, Australia. Methods/design. This RCT will be conducted with a consecutive sample of 782 first time mothers with their newborn children. Pregnant women who are expecting their first child, and who are between weeks 24 and 34 of their pregnancy, will be invited to participate in the trial at the antenatal clinic. Informed consent will be obtained and participants will then be randomly allocated to the intervention or the control group. The allocation will be concealed by sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes containing a computer generated random number. The intervention comprises eight home visits from a specially trained community nurse over two years and pro-active telephone support between the visits. Main outcomes include a) duration of breastfeeding measured at 6 and 12 months, b) introduction of solids measured at 4 and 6 months, c) nutrition, physical activity and television viewing measured at 24 months, and d) overweight/obesity status at age 2 and 5 years. Discussion. The results of this trial will ascertain whether the home based early intervention is effective in preventing the early onset of childhood overweight and obesity. If proved to be effective, it will result in a series of recommendations for policy and practical methods for promoting healthy feeding and physical activity of children in the first two years of life with particular application to families who are socially and economically disadvantaged. √É‚Äö√Ç¬© 2007 Wen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1471-2458-7-76,Nutrition and exercise,,,,Field experiment,It is a regular RCT.,782,"The provided description does not include the results of the study or indicate whether the study showed statistically significant results.

Schofield M.J.; Sanson-Fisher R.W.; Gulliver S.,Interventions with retailers to reduce cigarette sales to miners: A randomised controlled trial,1997,"We aimed to determine the relative effectiveness of an education intervention and a threat-of-enforcement intervention in reducing sales of cigarettes to under-age youth by randomly allocating 300 retailers in a nonmetropolitan region of New South Wales to: a control group with no intervention; a minimal-intervention group, which received an educational letter; and a maximal-intervention group, which received a threat of enforcement followed by a visit from a public health officer. Retailers were checked for compliance at pretest and post-test, six months apart, by twelve 18-year-olds who were judged by independent raters to look younger. The retailers were surveyed by telephone at both times for knowledge, attitudes and self-reported sales practices. Neither intervention achieved significant improvements for the two key behavioural outcomes: requiring proof of age and display of a warning sign. Neither was there an intervention effect on knowledge about the law. The greatest improvement in the proportion of retailers who believed that the legal age should be 18 or over was in the minimal-intervention group, and both intervention groups were less likely than the control group at post-test to think that it was acceptable to sell to a person who was nearly 18. There was poor overall compliance with the revised legislation at pre-test. The finding of a pretest-to-post-test improvement but no differential intervention effect highlights the methodological difficulties of such research. The interventions may, however, have been partly successful in modifying the attitudes of retailers.",10.1111/j.1467-842x.1997.tb01761.x,Health,,,,Field experiment,A regular RCT,300,The study did not show statistically significant results for the two key behavioral outcomes: requiring proof of age and the display of a warning sign.

Mitchell J.; Palmer S.; Booth M.; Davies G.P.,A randomised trial of an intervention to develop health promoting schools in Australia: The south western Sydney study,2000,"Objective: This paper describes the evaluation of a health promoting schools intervention carried out in the south western region of Sydney, Australia. The evaluation sought to assess the project's impact on structures to support the health promoting school concept and changes in health-related policies and practices within 22 local schools. Methods: A randomised controlled study was employed. Intervention schools were offered seminars and training in the health promoting schools concept, encouraged to use a resource kit to help them establish their school as health promoting and invited to participate in a support network. Pre- and post measures of awareness, school structures and policies and practices to support the development of a health promoting school were taken and intervention and control schools compared. Results: There was an increased level of awareness of the health promoting school concept among intervention schools. However, there were no significant changes in health-related policies and practices at the school level, among both intervention and control schools. Conclusions: A longer time frame and more structured support are required to influence school structures to support the development of a health promoting school. Implications: To facilitate organisational change in schools, health promoting school interventions need to provide structured support for schools and recognise that change takes time. A committee to initiate action, a plan to guide work and school support are likely to facilitate the adoption of the health promoting schools approach. Further work to refine the measurement of school-based action and its outcome and the development of indicators for a health promoting school is needed.",10.1111/j.1467-842X.2000.tb01563.x,Health,,,,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,22 schools,The study did not show statistically significant results in terms of changes in health-related policies and practices at the school level among both intervention and control schools.

Stewart S.; Horowitz J.D.,Home-based intervention in congestive heart failure long-term implications on readmission and survival,2002,"Background - It is not known to what extent initially observed benefits of postdischarge programs of care for patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) in respect to event-free survival, readmissions, and healthcare costs persist in the long term. Methods and Results - We prospectively studied the long-term effects of a multidisciplinary home-based intervention (HBI) in a cohort of CHF patients randomly allocated to either to HBI (n=149) or usual care (n=148). During a median of 4.2 years of follow-up, there were significantly fewer primary end points (unplanned readmission or death) in the HBI versus usual care group: a mean of 0.21 versus 0.37 primary events per patient per month (P<0.01). Median event-free survival was more prolonged in the HBI than usual care group (7 versus 3 months; P<0.01). Fewer HBI patients died (56% versus 65%; P=0.06) and had more prolonged survival (a median of 40 versus 22 months; P<0.05) compared with usual care. Assignment to HBI was both an independent predictor of event-free survival (RR 0.70; P<0.01) and survival alone (RR 0.72; P<0.05). Overall, HBI patients had 78 fewer unplanned readmissions compared with usual care (0.17 versus 0.29 readmissions per patient per month; P<0.05). The median cost of these readmissions was $A325 versus $A660/month per HBI and usual care patient (P<0.01).

This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a multifaceted dissemination strategy compared with a simple mail-out strategy in promoting the adoption of comprehensive SunSmart skin protection policies and practices in primary and secondary schools in New South Wales. It also aimed to examine characteristics of the primary and secondary schools that adopted a comprehensive SunSmart policy before and after the intervention. Four hundred randomly selected primary schools and all 381 high schools in New South Wales were randomised to one of two intervention groups. Pretest and post-test surveys of principals were undertaken in 1991 and 1992. Intervention 1 was a simple mail-out of a sample sun-protection policy kit. Intervention 2 comprised the mail-out of the policy kit and a follow-up mail-out of a staff development module. There was a strong intervention effect on adoption of a comprehensive sun-protection policy in primary schools (21 per cent for the 'mail' group compared with 44 per cent for 'mail and staff support' group) but not in high schools (6 per cent and 11 per cent).

A prospective randomised controlled trial was undertaken in 267 patients aged 70 years and over (mean age = 78.3 years). Following discharge from hospital, patients were followed up at three monthly intervals for a total of 12 months. At the time of discharge, no significant differences were found in inpatient management, length of stay, mortality rates, discharge rates to institutional care or utilisation of community services in patients admitted to the GAU and the GMUs. Similarly, no significant differences were found at three, six, nine, and 12 month follow up in case fatality, activities of daily living indices, mental health status, rates of institutional referral and the level of community service support in patients admitted to the GAU and the GMUs studied. These findings do not show any advantage for the unselected 70 + acutely ill elderly patient who is admitted to a designated geriatric assessment unit rather than to a general medical unit. Therefore, an admission policy to GAU, based solely on age 70 + is medically inappropriate and cost√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬êinefficient. Evidence from other sources suggests that an age cohort of acutely admitted patients beyond 80 years may well have returned more optimistic findings for the GAU. In future, GAUs will require a more selective admission policy to maximise the benefits of their rehabilitative and interdisciplinary approach. (Aust NZ J Med 1991; 21: 230√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì234.)

Steinberg M.; Cartwright C.; Peel N.; Williams G.,A sustainable programme to prevent falls and near falls in community dwelling older people: Results of a randomised trial,2000,"Study objective - In the causative mechanism of falls among older community dwellers, slips and trips have been found to be significant precursors. The purpose of the two year trial was to assess the effectiveness of multi-component interventions targeting major risk factors for falls in reducing the incidence of slips, trips and falls among the well, older community. Design - Four groups with approximately equal numbers of participants were randomly allocated to interventions. The prevention strategies included education and awareness raising of falls risk factors, exercise sessions to improve strength and balance, home safety advice to modify environmental hazards, and medical assessment to optimise health. The interventions combined the strategies in an add on approach. The first intervention group receiving the information session only was regarded as the control. The outcome of interest was the occurrence of a slip, trip or fall, monitored prospectively using a daily calendar diary. Participants and setting - Two hundred and fifty two members of the National Seniors Association in the Brisbane district agreed to participate. National Seniors clubs provide a forum for active, community dwelling Australians aged 50 and over to participate in policy, personal development and recreation. Main results - Using Cox's proportional hazards regression model, adjusted hazard ratios comparing intervention groups with the control ranged from 0.35 (95% CI 0.17, 0.73) to 0.48 (0.25, 0.91) for slips; 0.29 (0.16, 0.51) to 0.45 (0.27, 0.74) for trips; and 0.60 (0.36, 1.01) to 0.82 (0.51, 1.31) for falls. While calendar monitoring recorded outcome, it was also assessed as a prevention strategy by comparing the intervention groups with a hypothetical non-intervened group. At one year after intervention, reductions in the probability of slips, trips and falls (61(95% CI 54, 66)%; 56 (49, 63)%; 29 (22, 36)% respectively) were demonstrated.

Craig Jones,Intensive judicial supervision and drug court outcomes: interim findings from a randomised controlled trial,2011,"There is strong evidence that intensively supervising drug court participants in the early phases reduces early-phase substance use and sanctioning rates.

This paper assesses whether intensive judicial supervision (IJS) during the early stages of drug court reduces drug use and sanctioning rates.

Method: The study employed a non-blinded randomised controlled trial to test the effect of IJS on early-phase substance use and sanctioning rates. All participants accepted onto the Parramatta Drug Court program between March 2010 and March 2011 were randomly allocated into either an IJS or supervision as usual (SAU) condition. The IJS group had phase 1 of their program extended from three to four months and appeared before the judge two times per week during phase 1. The SAU group appeared once per week for three months during phase 1.

Results: Participants in the IJS group were significantly less likely to return positive urinalysis tests and had a significantly greater number of episodes of abstinence than participants in the SAU group. IJS participants were less likely to accrue sanctions than participants in the SAU group. There was no significant difference in the odds of having sanctions waived or having to serve sanctions in prison between the two groups.

BETA,Nudge vs superbugs: a behavioural economics trial to reduce the overprescribing of antibiot\ics,2018,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest threats to human health today. AMR occurs when microorganisms, such as bacteria, become resistant to an antimicrobial medicine, such as antibiotics. Resistant infections are more difficult to treat and, in some cases, untreatable. It can affect anyone, of any age, and in any country.

Australians use a lot of antibiotics and this increases the chance for bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotics.

Within Australia, General Practitioners (GPs) currently prescribe the greatest portion of antibiotics due to the types of illnesses seen and the large volumes of patients. This makes GPs important partners in efforts to minimise AMR by helping limit community prescribing to only those clinical situations where evidence shows antibiotics to be of proven value.

We applied behavioural insights to design letters sent by the Australian Government‚Äôs Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to high-prescribing GPs. In particular, we used peer comparison by comparing GPs‚Äô prescribing rates with those of other GPs in their region.

We undertook a randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving 6,649 GPs to test the impact of our letters. Just as RCTs are regarded as the ‚Äògold standard‚Äô for testing clinical interventions, they are increasingly being used to determine what works in public policy.

As part of our RCT, the CMO wrote to GPs whose prescribing rates were in the top 30 per cent for their region. The letters aimed to prompt GPs to reflect on whether there were opportunities to reduce prescribing where appropriate and safe. The letters were sent on 9 June 2017, just before the rapid increase in prescribing which occurs during the cold and flu season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,APO search,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,"6,649",The description does not provide information on whether the study showed statistically significant results or what the specific results were.,Health; Public administration
"Joula Dekker, Nadine Smith, Kate O'Brien",An evaluation of the compulsory drug treatment program (CDTP),2010,"In 2003, the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOCSAR) was directed by the NSW Government to undertake a randomised controlled trial of the Compulsory Drug Treatment Program (CDTP). This proved impossible because the number of offenders eligible for the program was never large enough to conduct a meaningful randomised controlled trial. The number of offenders dealt with on the program was also too small to evaluate its effect on rates of re-offending. The evaluation was therefore limited to assessing the impact of the CDTP on the health and wellbeing of participants, measuring changes in perceived coercion, affective reactions, treatment readiness and therapeutic alliance, gauging participant satisfaction with various aspects of the program, and monitoring participants‚Äô drug use whilst on the program.

The research involved a series of face-to-face interviews with CDTP participants. Baseline interviews were conducted with 95 participants at the commencement of their time on the program. Three followup interviews were conducted as close to the time that participants finished Stages 1, 2 and 3, as was practicable. By the time data collection ceased, 78 per cent of the baseline sample (74 participants) had completed Stage 1 and participated in one follow-up interview (end of Stage 1), and 41 per cent of the baseline sample (39 participants; for some measures information is missing for one participant so N = 38) had completed both Stages 1 and 2 and participated in two follow-up interviews (end of Stages 1 and 2). Of the baseline sample, 13.5 per cent (13 participants) had completed all three follow-up interviews (end of Stages 1, 2, and 3).

"Sara Rahman, Suzanne Poynton, Don Weatherburn",The NSW Rolling List Court evaluation: final report,2018,"Aim: To assess whether the application of an alternative court model with fixed teams of lawyers operating on a rolling basis in the NSW District Criminal Court resulted in greater efficiency in the resolution of indictable criminal matters relative to the regular operation of the NSW District Court, and to identify the successful elements and mechanisms of the Rolling List Court (RLC) model.

Method: A randomised controlled trial was conducted in the NSW District Criminal Court (NSW DCC), where eligible matters were balloted with 50:50 odds to the RLC or the general list of the NSW DCC. The proportion of early guilty pleas relative to late guilty pleas, trials reaching a verdict and no-bills were compared between the courts, and survival analysis was used to analyse the time taken to reach a guilty plea and to finalise matters in both courts. Stakeholder interviews were conducted to identify the key mechanisms behind the RLC, as well as any other benefits or drawbacks of the model.

Results: More than half (58.0 %) of the matters balloted to the RLC resolved in a guilty plea before the trial date, compared to 22.0 per cent of the matters randomised to the general list of the NSW DCC. There were marked improvements in the average time taken to reach a guilty plea (t=-3.43; p-value.001), to list matters for trial (t=-5.14; p-value.001) and to finalise matters (t=-3.93; p-value.001) in the RLC. Further evidence of faster resolution in the RLC was found through survival analyses of the time taken to reach a guilty plea (HR=1.73; 95% CI (1.08, 2.78); p-value=.023) and to finalise matters (HR=1.90; 95% CI (1.29, 2.79); p-value=.001). Stakeholders interviewed indicated that early briefing and negotiation was crucial to obtaining earlier guilty pleas, and further benefits to efficiency arose from the fixed-team composition of the court.

Conclusion: The RLC proved effective at obtaining early guilty pleas and reducing delay in the processing of indictable criminal matters. The findings suggest that efforts to introduce some elements of the RLC, such as early briefing of practitioners and pre-trial negotiations, could have benefits for the NSW DCC‚Äôs efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2018-01/apo-nid126916.pdf,,,APO search,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

"Sustainability Victoria, University of Technology Sydney",The Victorian Healthy Homes Program: research findings,2022,"The Victorian Healthy Homes Program was a randomised controlled trial designed to measure the impact of an energy efficiency and thermal comfort home upgrade on temperature, energy use, health and quality of life. Analysis indicated that a relatively minor upgrade (average $2,809) had wide-ranging benefits over the winter period.

Average indoor temperature was increased by 0.33 degrees Celsius, with increases particularly strong in the morning, when temperatures are lowest. Exposure to cold temperatures (less than 18 degrees Celsius) was reduced by 43 minutes per day. Subjective experience of warmth is important; it does not always match temperature measurements. Householders in the intervention group were more than twice as likely as controls to report that their home felt warmer over winter. These gains in thermal comfort were obtained despite a significant reduction in gas use in upgraded homes, and no change in electricity use. There was no evidence of a rebound effect, with intervention participants less likely than controls to use their main heater and less likely to resort to other options to stay warm. Householders in the intervention group reported less condensation over winter.

Importantly, the upgrade was associated with benefits in health, with reduced breathlessness and improved quality of life, particularly its mental health and social care aspects. Health benefits of the upgrade were reflected in cost savings, with $887 per person saved in the healthcare system over the winter period. Cost-benefit analysis indicated that the upgrade would be cost saving within 3 years ‚Äì and would yield a net saving of $4,783 over 10 years ‚Äì due to savings in both energy and health.

"Paul Flatau, Ami Seivwright, Zoe Callis, Monica Thielking, Jessica Mackelprang, Kathryn Taylor, Louise La Sala",Chronic homelessness in Melbourne: first-year outcomes of the Journey to Social Inclusion phase two study,2018,"The Journey to Social Inclusion (J2SI) Phase 2 program, delivered by Sacred Heart Mission (SHM), uses an intensive case management approach focused on capacity building and relationship development to facilitate the movement of chronically homeless people in Melbourne to permanent, stable housing and a pathway to broader social inclusion. Phase 2 of the program arose out of the success of a pilot study (Johnson et al., 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014) that demonstrated high rates of housing attainment and retention. Sacred Heart Mission (SHM) has enlisted the Centre for Social Impact at The University of Western Australia (CSI UWA), in collaboration with Swinburne University of Technology, to lead a longitudinal research study to evaluate the J2SI Phase 2 program. The research study is a randomised control trial (RCT) where eligible study participants, were randomised upon recruitment and after the Baseline survey into the J2SI Phase 2 program, termed the J2SI group, or the comparison group that continues to receive homelessness services as usual, termed the E group (existing services). Some of those randomised to the J2SI group were not able to be contacted by the J2SI Phase 2 program team, left the geographical area covered by the program or did not engage with the program. This group is labelled the ‚ÄòI group‚Äô (Inactive group). Those in the J2SI group who remained engaged at the 12-month point are referred to as the Active J2SI group.

This report presents findings at the Year One time point in which we compare outcomes at the Wave 3 time point with those at Baseline using survey data that were collected during interviews with research study participants. The findings cover a broad range of wellbeing domains, including housing, physical health, mental health, alcohol and other drug (AOD) issues, health service utilisation, economic participation, social support and quality of life. The report examines outcomes for study participants as a whole, outcomes at Wave 3 compared with the Baseline broken down by permanent housing status at Wave 3, and outcomes achieved for J2SI Phase 2 participants relative to other participants. A detailed analysis of the latter issue will be undertaken at the completion of the project and published in the final report.

One hundred and eighty valid responses were obtained at Baseline in the study‚Äôs longitudinal survey. For various reasons, including participant deaths, withdrawal from the study, and loss to follow-up, 134 complete responses were collected at Wave 3.

BETA,Improved compliance with the Deferred GST Scheme,2018,"The Australian Taxation Office is the Australian Government‚Äôs principal revenue collection agency and administers Australia‚Äôs tax system and significant aspects of Australia‚Äôs superannuation system. It administers legislation governing tax, superannuation and the Australian Business Register and supports the delivery of government benefits to the community. Improving tax compliance is a major policy goal as non-compliance can reduce the overall tax base, increase the costs of administration and lead to an uneven playing field for businesses doing the right thing.

As part of the legislation the Deferred Goods and Services Tax (DGST) Scheme allows businesses to defer the payment of GST on taxable imports until the goods have been sold. This helps businesses manage their cash flow. Cash flow is important for businesses because it helps them meet everyday business needs and avoid taking on more debt. This means there is a strong driver for businesses to be on the Scheme. Participation in the Scheme allows 13,000 businesses to defer payment of $26 billion in GST annually.

To be on the Scheme, businesses must comply with requirements including digital lodgment of monthly activity statements and being up to date on all lodgments and payments due to the ATO. At any one time about one in three businesses do not comply. The ATO can revoke access to the Scheme if a business does not fully comply, which negatively affects cash flow and means the business will need to reapply to be reinstated.

BETA partnered with the ATO to test behaviourally informed methods of communication (variations on emails) aimed at improving compliance among businesses in the Scheme. We ran two separate randomised controlled trials to test the effectiveness of these emails.

The first trial evaluated the impact of sending a ‚Äòcooperative‚Äô or ‚Äòdirect‚Äô toned reminder email to existing businesses who were found to be non-compliant with the Scheme. The aim was to encourage self-compliance, educate businesses on their tax obligations and reduce recurrent non-compliance. Both emails improved compliance rates but variations in the tone of the reminders did not affect the compliance rate.

The second trial tested the effectiveness of sending a welcome email to new businesses who had just registered on the Scheme. The aim of the email was to educate the businesses from the first point of contact to promote good compliance behaviours and engagement with the ATO. The email contained a planning prompt recommending businesses set up a monthly calendar reminder about their DGST obligations. It did not improve compliance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,APO search,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,"The study showed statistically significant results for the first trial, where both 'cooperative' and 'direct' toned reminder emails improved compliance rates among existing non",Public administration; Business

Ju X.; Mittinty M.N.; Smithers L.; Jamieson L.,Early Childhood Caries Intervention in Aboriginal Australian Children: A Cross-in Randomized Trial,2024,"Introduction: Early childhood caries (ECC) is the strongest predictor of dental caries in adulthood. Indigenous children have higher levels of ECC compared with non-Indigenous children. The study aimed to estimate the efficacy of an ECC intervention among Aboriginal Australian children. Methods: Baby Teeth Talk was an outcome assessor-blinded, closed-cohort cross-in randomized controlled trial conducted in South Australia, Australia. We randomly allocated 448 women pregnant with an Aboriginal child to either an immediate (II) or delayed (DI) intervention group between January 2011 and May 2012. The immediate intervention comprised (1) provision of dental care to mothers during pregnancy; (2) application of fluoride varnish to teeth of children at ages 6, 12; and 18 mo; (3) motivational interviewing delivered in conjunction; and (4) anticipatory guidance. Mothers/children in the DI group received the same intervention commencing when the child was 24 mo of age. The outcomes were assessed by the number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth (dmft) in children aged 24, 36, and 60 mo. Regression-based approaches with generalized linear mixed effect (log-Poisson) model characterized the mean dmft to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: A total of 223 participants were randomly allocated to the II group and 225 to the DI group. Three hundred sixty-five children (178 II, 187 DI) received at least 1 dental clinical examination at 24, 36, and 60 mo of follow-up. The mean dmft was lower in the II group (0.48, 1.32, and 2.06) than in the DI group (0.82, 1.90, and 3.29) at each time point, respectively. The direct ECC intervention effect was to prevent/decrease dental decay experience (dmft) occurrence by 84% (RR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.20‚Äì2.48) after adjusting for all covariates. Conclusions: Our analysis indicated that the time-varied ECC intervention had immediate and longer-term effects on the prevention of ECC among Indigenous Australian children. Knowledge Transfer Statement: The study aimed to estimate the efficacy of an early childhood caries (ECC) intervention among Aboriginal Australian children. The findings indicated that the culturally appropriate ECC intervention is effective for the preventive of ECC and can be used by clinicians, educators, and policy makers when planning an ECC intervention, so as to prevent and reduce ECC and meet identified oral health needs across the Australian population, which is important for preventive dental care. ¬© The Author(s) 2023.",10.1177/23800844231191714,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Cross-in randomized controlled trial,448,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Accessing psychological treatments in a prison setting is a particular challenge, in part, due to difficulties accessing specialist mental health workers. Behavioural Activation (BA) may be helpful in improving health outcomes for people in custody experiencing depressive symptoms. The aim of this study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of custodial health nurses delivering BA to improve depressive symptoms of people in custody. We will conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial with process observation examining the feasibility and acceptability of BA in treating people in custody with depressive symptoms. 60 people in custody presenting with depressive symptoms will be randomised to receive BA plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU provided by custodial health nurses. Eight custodial health nurses will be recruited, trained, and deliver BA. BA will be delivered twice a week for six weeks, with sessions lasting up to 30 minutes. Changes in depression and quality of life (QoL) will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months post-intervention. Participants will be interviewed to understand feasibility and acceptability of BA in prison settings. The findings will inform the design of a randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of BA for people in custody with depression. Findings will help determine whether BA for depression is suited to prison health care system and services. Improving depressive symptoms in people in custody has benefits beyond prison settings. The Central Adelaide Local Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee and University of South Australia Human Research Ethics Committee have approved the study. The trial results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences and reported to local stakeholders and policy makers. If feasibility and acceptability is demonstrated, we will seek to progress to an effectiveness study. A potential strength of the trial model proposed, is in its scalability, with potential to increase the trial sites and locations.  ¬© 2024 Walsh et al.

This study aims to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally and contextually informed Aboriginal Diabetes Workforce Training Program on Aboriginal primary health care workforce knowledge, attitude, confidence, skill and practice relating to diabetes care. Methods A Cluster Randomised Crossover Control Trial with two arms (Group A and Group B) will be conducted with Aboriginal primary health care services in South Australia. These services primarily provide primary health care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. All healthcare service sites will be randomised into groups A and B to receive the training program. The training program consists of three components: 1) Peer support network, 2) E-Learning modules and 3) onsite support. Aboriginal Health Workers of participating sites will be invited to participate in the monthly online peer support network and all chronic disease staff are eligible to participate in the E-Learning modules and onsite support. The Peer Support Network runs for the entirety of the study, 17 months. Training components 2 and 3 occur simultaneously and are 2.5 months in length, with a six-month washout period between the two randomised groups undertaking the training.

Watchorn D.J.; Doherty T.S.; Wilson B.A.; Garkaklis M.J.; Driscoll D.A.,Artificial refuges did not increase small mammal abundance after fire,2024,"The interacting threats of invasive predators and altered fire regimes are key conservation issues for many native species globally. Artificial refuges have been proposed as a potential conservation tool to provide prey species with protection from invasive predators after fire, but we do not yet know whether they improve animal survival. To address this knowledge gap, we experimentally tested how small mammal abundance and species richness were influenced by the provision of artificial refuges after prescribed burns. We surveyed small mammals across five unburnt sites, seven burnt sites with artificial refuges, and eight burnt control sites following two prescribed fires in southeastern Australia. There were negative and neutral responses of small mammals to the burns, and relative abundance was positively correlated with structurally complex vegetation. Artificial refuges had no impact on abundance or species richness, irrespective of burn coverage. These findings suggest that this artificial refuge design may not be an effective tool for improving small mammal population persistence postfire, and as such we should not yet scale up their application. However, given the inherent context-dependency of field experiments involving fire, which include difficult-to-control variables such as fire severity, predator activity, and population dynamics, we encourage researchers to undertake further experiments with artificial refuges in fire-affected areas, including after severe wildfires when less vegetation cover remains. Such studies will help to build our understanding of their utility as a conservation tool across different ecosystems and fire types. ¬© 2024 The Authors.

Bentley L.A.; Eager R.; Savage S.; Nielson C.; White S.L.J.; Williams K.E.,"A translational application of music for preschool cognitive development: RCT evidence for improved executive function, self-regulation, and school readiness",2023,"The benefits of active music participation and training for cognitive development have been evidenced in multiple studies, with this link leveraged in music therapy approaches with clinical populations. Although music, rhythm, and movement activities are widely integrated into children's play and early education, few studies have systematically translated music therapy-based approaches to a nonclinical population to support early cognitive development. This study reports the follow-up effects of the Rhythm and Movement for Self Regulation (RAMSR) program delivered by generalist preschool teachers in low socioeconomic communities. This randomized control trial (RCT) involved 213 children across eight preschools in disadvantaged communities in Queensland, Australia. The intervention group received 16‚Äì20 sessions of RAMSR over 8 weeks, while the control group undertook usual preschool programs. Primary outcome measures included executive function (child assessment of shifting, working memory, and inhibition) and self-regulation (teacher report), with secondary outcomes of school readiness and visual-motor integration. Data were collected pre- and post-intervention, and again 6 months later once children had transitioned into school. Results demonstrated significant intervention effects across the three time points for school readiness (p¬†=¬†0.038, Œ∑p2¬†=¬†0.09), self-regulation (p¬†<¬†0.001, Œ∑p2¬†=¬†0.08), and inhibition (p¬†=¬†0.002 Œ∑p2¬†=¬†0.23). Additionally, the feasibility of building capacity in teachers without any music background to successfully deliver the program was evidenced. These findings are important given that children from low socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to need support for cognitive development yet have inequitable access to quality music and movement programs. Research Highlights: Initial effects of self-regulation from a rhythm and movement program were sustained following transition into school for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Delayed effects of inhibition and school readiness from a rhythm and movement program appeared 6 months post-intervention as children entered school. Generalist teachers can successfully implement a rhythm and movement program, which boosts critical developmental cognitive skills. ¬© 2022 The Authors.

Health authorities need evidence about effective communication interventions to improve acceptance and uptake. This study aimed to test effects of persuasive messages about COVID- 19 vaccine booster doses on intention to vaccinate amongst eligible adults in Australia. Methods In this online randomised controlled trial, adult participants received one of four intervention messages or a control message. The control message provided information about booster dose eligibility. Intervention messages added to the control message, each using a different persuasive strategy, including: emphasising personal health benefits of booster doses, community health benefits, non-health benefits, and personal agency in choosing vaccination. After the intervention, participants answered items about COVID-19 booster vaccine intention and beliefs. Intervention groups were compared to the control using tests of two proportions; differences of ‚â•5 percentage points were deemed clinically significant. A sub-group analysis was conducted among hesitant participants. Results Of the 487 consenting and randomised participants, 442 (90.8%) completed the experiment and were included in the analysis. Participants viewing messages emphasising non-health benefits had the highest intention compared to those who viewed the control message (percentage point diff: 9.0, 95% CI -0.8, 18.8, p = 0.071). Intention was even higher among hesitant individuals in this intervention group compared to the control group (percentage point diff: 15.6, 95% CI -6.0, 37.3, p = 0.150). Conversely, intention was lower among hesitant individuals who viewed messages emphasising personal agency compared to the control group (percentage point diff: -10.8, 95% CI -33.0, 11.4, p = 0.330), although evidence in support of these findings is weak. Conclusion Health authorities should highlight non-health benefits to encourage COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake but use messages emphasising personal agency with caution. These findings can inform communication message development and strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake.  ¬© 2023 Steffens et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0286799,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Regular RCT,487,"The study did not show statistically significant results.

Method The Personalised Health Care (PHC) pilot study was a randomised trial with an economic evaluation alongside over 12 months. From a health service perspective, the primary analysis compared the costs and effectiveness of PHC telehealth monitoring with usual care. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated based on costs and health-related quality of life. The PHC intervention was implemented in the Barwon Health region, Geelong, Australia, for patients with a diagnosis of COPD and/or diabetes who had a high likelihood of hospital readmission over 12 months. Results When compared to usual care at 12 months, the PHC intervention cost AUD$714 extra per patient (95%CI -4879; 6308) with a significant improvement of 0.09 in health-related quality of life (95%CI: 0.05; 0.14). The probability of PHC being cost-effective by 12 months was close to 65%, at willingness to pay a threshold of AUD$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year. Conclusion Benefits of PHC to patients and the health system at 12 months translated to a gain in quality- adjusted life years with a non-significant cost difference between the intervention and control groups. Given the relatively high set-up costs of the PHC intervention, the program may need to be offered to a larger population to achieve cost-effectiveness. Long-term follow- up is required to assess the real health and economic benefits over time.  ¬© 2023 Mudiyanselage et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0286533,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Full study with results.,Something else,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,The study showed a statistically significant improvement in health-related quality of life of 0.09 (95%CI: 0.05; 0,Health

Our study aim was to evaluate Goodform, a 4-session, teacher delivered intervention program specifically developed for boys to reduce body dissatisfaction and muscle building supplement use. The Goodform program was based on cognitive dissonance, social learning theory, and a social norms approach, and drew from two existing body image intervention programs that have shown promise among males: The Body Project- More than Muscles, and the Athletes Training and Learning to Avoid Steroids Program (ATLAS). A sample of 488 boys in grades 9 and 10 (Mage = 14.81, SDage = 0.51) at nine secondary schools in Australia were randomly assigned to Goodform (n = 244) or control (n = 244) at the school level. Self-reported body image, supplement use, anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) use, and attitudes around using AAS and muscle building supplements were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and eight-week follow-up.

Early diagnosis and intervention are a priority, but while current post-intensive care follow-up processes endorse a multidisciplinary model, incorporating a psychiatric consultation has not been studied. Methods A pilot, open-label randomised controlled trial was developed by a multidisciplinary team to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of incorporating a psychiatric review into an existing post-ICU clinic. The study will run for 12 months and aim to recruit 30 participants. Inclusion criteria for participants: a) ICU admission greater than 48 hours, b) no cognitive impairment that prevents participation, c) ‚â• 18 years old, d) residing in Australia, e) fluent in English, f) able to provide GP information, and g) likely to be contactable in 6 months. Patient recruitment will be at Redcliffe Hospital, Queensland, Australia, and will involve patients attending the Redcliffe post intensive care clinic. Participants will be allocated to intervention or control using block randomisation and allocation concealment. Participants allocated to the control arm will receive the standard cares provided by the clinic, which involves an unstructured interview about their ICU experience and a battery of surveys about their psychological, cognitive, and physical function. Those allocated to the intervention arm will receive these same cares as well as an appointment with a psychiatrist for a single session intervention. The psychiatric intervention will involve a comprehensive review, including comorbid disorders, substance use, suicidal ideation, psychosocial stressors, social/emotional supports. Psychoeducation and initial treatment will be provided as indicated and recommendations given to the patient and their GP about how to access ongoing care. In addition to surveys conducted as part of standard clinic cares, all participants will complete additional questionnaires about their history, hospital experience, mental and physical health as well as employment circumstances. All participants will be followed up 6 months after their appointment and will be invited to complete follow-up questionnaires about their mental and physical health, as well as health service use and employment circumstances. The trial has been registered with ANZCTR (ACTRN12622000894796). Results To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention to the patient population. Differences between groups will be assessed using an independent samples t-test. Resource requirements to administer the intervention will be evaluated by reporting the mean duration of the EPARIS assessment and approximate cost per patient to provide this service. To estimate the effect size of any treatment effects, changes in secondary outcome measures between baseline and 6 months will be compared between intervention and control groups using Analysis of Covariance regression. As this is a pilot, we will not use p-values or test a null hypothesis, but will give confidence intervals. Conclusions This protocol provides a pragmatic evaluation of the acceptability of introducing early psychiatric assessment into an existing post-ICU follow-up process, and if considered acceptable will inform future research into the efficacy and generalisability of the intervention. The strengths of EPARIS are the prospective, longitudinal design with a control population, and its use of validated post-ICU outcome measures. ¬© 2023 Flaws et al.

Method: Using the six-step intervention mapping (IM) framework, this paper describes the development and content of the PharMIbridge pharmacist training programme, an integral part of the RCT implementation, and continuous adaptations made to the process to keep pace with the evolving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in Australia. A Training Working Group comprising health educators, practitioners, mental health consumers and researchers, refined the programme objectives and assisted with developing content and troubleshooting issues related to training delivery for pharmacists randomised to the RCT intervention arm. Results: A 2-day training programme was developed, which included Mental Health First Aid, simulated patient role-plays, and four pre-recorded modules using lectures, demonstration case vignettes, role-play activities and discussion. The programme, co-facilitated by project team members and mentors (pharmacist and consumer educators), aims to enhance pharmacists‚Äô mental health literacy, skills and confidence and empower them to engage with this vulnerable population using a strengths-based approach. Pre- and post-training questionnaires and interviews will be used to evaluate the impact of the PharMIbridge training programme. Conclusion: The systematic stepwise method provided by the IM framework highlights the solution-focused approach adopted by the project team and characteristics including adaptability and resilience which enabled training development and implementation across four Australian regions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. ¬© The Author(s) 2022.",10.1177/00178969221130461,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a protocol/pre-analysis plan.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The description does not provide information on whether the study showed statistically significant results or what the specific results were.

This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of an 8-week multi-strategy behavioral intervention that included vegetable provisioning and online menu architecture on vegetable sales in primary school canteens. A randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 16 Australian primary schools (n = 4302 students). The control arm kept their regular canteen menu. The primary outcome was vegetable sales measured by assessing vegetable content (in grams) from all menu items and using canteen sales (ordered online and over-the-counter) to calculate vegetable sales (in grams/week) at baseline (3 weeks) and during intervention implementation (8 weeks). Secondary outcomes were vegetable sales in subcategories, intervention acceptability among canteen managers and vegetable waste (four schools). Linear mixed model analysis showed that from baseline to follow-up, the intervention group had significantly higher weekly vegetable sales overall compared with the control group (2707 g/week, 95% CI 1276 to 4137 g/week; p < 0.001), with increased vegetable sales in the subcategories of burgers, hot foods and snacks, but not in sandwiches and pasta/rice dishes. The intervention did not lead to more vegetable waste, nor to a decrease in canteen revenue. The canteen managers found the intervention easy to implement and felt children responded favorably to three of the seven strategies. In conclusion, a multi-strategy behavioral canteen intervention increased vegetable sales amongst primary school students. ¬© 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/nu14194218,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,4302 students,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Pharmacists are trained in pharmacology and therapeutics, and therefore well placed to act as non-medical prescribers. Objectives: To assess the safety and accuracy of inpatient medication charts within a pharmacist collaborative prescribing model (intervention), compared to the usual medical model (control) in the emergency department (ED). Another objective compared venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment and prescribing, between intervention and control groups. Methods: Adult patients in ED referred for hospital admission were randomised into control or intervention by a block randomisation method, until the required sample size was reached. Medication charts were audited retrospectively by an independent auditor, using validated audit forms. Results: Intervention group medication charts contained significantly fewer prescribing errors, omissions and discrepancies compared to the control group, and improved documentation of adverse drug reactions. VTE risk assessment and prescribing had higher guideline concordance in the intervention group compared to the control group. Conclusions: This collaborative prescribing trial showed excellent results in safety and accuracy of pharmacist prescribing when compared to the usual medical model of prescribing.

Scott J.E.T.; Mazzucchelli T.G.; Luszcz M.A.; Walker R.; Windsor T.D.,A behavioural activation intervention to increase engagement with life and wellbeing in older adults: Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,2022,"Background: Meaningful activity engagement is a critical element of ageing well. Interventions designed to increase activity engagement tend to be activity-specific and do not always meet the needs of older adults with diverse interests and capacities. Behavioural activation (BA) provides a promising person-centred framework for promoting engagement in valued activities. This study will examine the effectiveness of a behavioural activation-based intervention for promoting engagement with life and wellbeing among older adults. Method: Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two conditions (BA intervention, Active Control) and take part in a six-week intervention that consists of one-on-one weekly sessions of up to one hour to be administered either via telephone or online video conferencing with a trained facilitator. This study will recruit 120 + participants aged 65 + who score at or below the median on a test of life engagement. Participants will complete questionnaires of primary and secondary measures both pre-program, one-week and three months post-program. Participants will also complete a daily diary questionnaire during the fourth and fifth weeks of the intervention. The primary outcome measure is the Life Engagement Test, and secondary outcome measures include assessments of subjective wellbeing, psychological wellbeing, mental health, self-reported health, social engagement, loneliness and life satisfaction. Discussion: The outcomes from this study will provide evidence as to whether a BA based approach represents an effective method for promoting engagement with life and wellbeing among older community-dwelling adults.

Learning to Lead (L2L) is a student-led, primary schoolbased leadership program whereby older 'peer leaders' deliver a fundamental movement skills (FMS) program to younger 'peers' within their own school. Aim The aims of the study are to determine the efficacy of a peer-led FMS intervention on: (i) peer leaders' (aged 10 to 12 years) leadership effectiveness (primary outcome), leadership self-efficacy, well-being, and time on-task in the classroom; (ii) peers' (aged 8 to 10 years) physical activity levels, actual and perceived FMS competency, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular power, and executive functioning; and (iii) teachers' (referred to as 'school champions') work-related stress and well-being. Method L2L will be evaluated using a two-arm parallel group cluster randomised controlled trial. Twenty schools located within a two-hour drive of the University of Newcastle, Australia will be recruited. We will recruit 80 students (40 peer leaders and 40 peers) from each school (N = 1,600). L2L will be implemented in three phases: Phase 1 -school champions' training via a professional learning workshop; Phase 2 -school champions' delivery of leadership lessons to the peer leaders; and Phase 3 -peer leaders' delivery of the FMS program to their younger peers. The FMS program, consisting of 12 x 30-minute lessons, will be delivered over the course of one school term (10 weeks). Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline (between mid-March to June, Terms 1 and 2), intervention end (mid-August to September, Term 3), and follow-up (November to mid-December, Term 4.  ¬© 2023 Wade et al.

Gore J.; Rickards B.; Fray L.,From performative to professional accountability: re-imagining ‚Äòthe field of judgment‚Äô through teacher professional development,2023,"The rise of performative culture in education and intensifying forms of test-based accountability have subjected teachers to a ubiquitous ‚Äòfield of judgment‚Äô through which they are held to account. Within this context, professional development is consistently deployed as a key solution to stagnant or declining student outcomes. In this paper, we examine how accountability might be reimagined through one approach to professional development known as Quality Teaching Rounds (QTR). We draw on Foucault‚Äôs notion of panopticism and Ball‚Äôs influential writings on performativity to analyse interviews with 21 educators from 14 schools in New South Wales, Australia, conducted during a 2014‚Äì2015 randomised controlled trial. Participants highlighted the pervasiveness of testing and test results in shaping their experience of teaching in a system of perpetual surveillance where numbers bite deep into practice. By contrast, participation in QTR afforded teachers rare spaces of freedom within the structure of performativity to collaboratively focus on pedagogy. We argue meaningful professional development can alter the field of judgment and enable teachers to reclaim accountability on their own terms, while maintaining a clear focus on student outcomes. ¬© 2022 The Author(s).

Alexander K.; Humphreys C.; Wise S.; Zhou A.,Bringing Dignity to the Assessment of Safety for Children who Live with Violence,2022,"Fear dominates women and children‚Äôs experience of domestic violence. Fear of harm, and the consequences of others finding out, can mean mothers are reluctant to seek help. Ironically, these survival behaviours can be understood as non-protective by child protection practitioners. This article describes research undertaken in New South Wales (NSW) Australia to determine the impact on child protection practitioner perceptions of child safety when Response-Based Practice (RBP) questions are combined with the standard NSW Structured Decision Making (SDM) safety assessment. RBP reflects core social work values through questions that explore how victims respond to, resist and manage violence. A vignette experiment with a between-subjects design was used to compare child safety assessments by practitioners who watched an interview guided by SDM alone and practitioners who watched an interview using the combined ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô (SDM√æRBP) approach. Participants (N ¬º 1,041) were randomly assigned to SDM and treatment groups. Participants who watched the treatment approach were significantly more likely to assess the mother as cooperative and protective and significantly less likely to indicate that the children would be taken from her care. Thus, the results demonstrate that understanding how women manage violence changes practitioner views about maternal protectiveness and child safety. ¬© The Author(s) 2022.",10.1093/bjsw/bcab260,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,A vignette experiment with a between-subjects design.,"1,041","Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Tian R.; Stojanovski E.; Miller D.,A novel application of multilevel SEM: Teaching quality as mediator between intervention and student achievement,2023,"Improving teaching quality has been an ongoing pursuit for policymakers, researchers and broader government agencies and organisations. Professional development (PD) initiatives directed at teachers are a recognised strategy for improving teaching quality, with the underlying intention to support improved student achievement. Yet there is limited evidence of the actual impact of PD directed at teachers on student learning outcomes. Quality Teaching Rounds (QTR), a well-recognised form of collaborative PD in Australia, is one of few approaches to provide evidence of impact on teaching quality and student outcomes. Through multiple Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), a statistically significant positive impact of QTR PD has been demonstrated on teaching practices and student outcomes. A further question that remains is whether the change in teaching quality through involvement in QTR PD improves student achievement. This underlying mechanism is yet to be explored in the QTR PD framework and has rarely been explored in PD settings internationally due to limited data that often prevents suitable statistical techniques to be employed. A clustered RCT investigating the impact of QTR PD on teaching quality and student achievement was conducted in 2019, involving 133 government primary schools in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Data were collected from 222 teachers and 5146 students in Stage 2 (years 3-4) in Term 1 and these teachers and students were followed up in Term 4 of the same year. Teaching practices were observed and rated in the classroom using a pedagogical model, the Quality Teaching (QT) model, which contains 18 observable elements within three dimensions of teaching practice (Intellectual Quality, Quality Learning Environment and Significance), while students were assessed using the Progressive Achievement Test (PAT) in mathematics, which was measured using the scaled scores on 40 multiple choice questions. The data structure therefore comprised a combination of multilevel and longitudinal features along with latent constructs and multiple intervention groups (QTR vs wait-list control) that were being compared. This paper examines the underlying interconnected relationships between PD, teaching quality and student achievement by testing the hypothesis that the impacts of the QTR intervention on student achievement in mathematics was mediated by teaching quality. Multilevel structural equation modelling (MSEM) with 2-2-1 design is investigated for these data. Student PAT scores in mathematics were significantly higher, on average (0.11SD [95% CI = 0.01,0.20]) in the intervention group (QTR) compared to those in the control group for the Intellectual Quality (IQ) dimension of the QT model. This demonstrates the statistically significant mediation effect of Intellectual Quality (IQ) on student learning outcomes. ¬© 2023 Proceedings of the International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM.

Feral cats have been implicated in causing declines and ongoing suppression of populations. Aims: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the response of small and medium-sized native mammal populations when cat predation was removed. Methods: A field experiment was conducted in a tropical savanna environment of northern Australia. Three experimental treatments were applied to six plots to compare and contrast responses of native mammals to predator exclusion and the additive effects of frequent fire. Plots were monitored regularly between 2013 and 2017. Key results: After 4 years of monitoring, no significant difference in capture rates of native mammals was detected between cat-accessible plots and those where they were excluded. Conclusions: There was no evidence of population recovery of native mammals in response to predator exclusion. There was some evidence that frequent burning, independent of cat exclusion, adversely affects native mammal diversity. Implications: Although predation by feral cats is a major threat to small and medium-sized native mammals, disturbance from fire, and grazing by introduced herbivores, have been shown to significantly impede native mammal population recovery in tropical savanna ecosystems. Management programs that solely focus on suppressing feral cat populations may be inadequate in ameliorating ongoing mammal declines in landscapes with other significant disturbance regimes.  ¬© 2022 CSIRO.",10.1071/WR21073,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,The sample size is not given.,"No, the study did not show statistically significant results.

This cluster randomised controlled trial aimed to test the effectiveness of a menu audit and feedback strategy alone, and in combination with online menu labels in encouraging healthier purchasing from an online school canteen ordering system. Five intervention schools received a menu audit and feedback strategy, plus online menu labels; and five control schools received a delayed menu audit and feedback strategy.

Outcomes were assessed at baseline (pre-intervention), follow-up 1 (menu audit and feedback vs control), and follow-up 2 (menu audit and feedback plus online menu labels vs menu audit and feedback alone). From baseline to follow-up 1, the menu audit and feedback strategy alone had no significant effect on the proportion of healthy (‚ÄòEveryday‚Äô) and less healthy (‚ÄòOccasional‚Äô or ‚ÄòShould not be sold‚Äô) items purchased.

Research has suggested that resilience can be learned and that schools can play an important role in developing resilient skills among youth; however, rigorous evaluation of interventions promoting resilience is limited. Aims: As martial arts training has been found to have psychological benefits such as increased confidence and self-esteem, this study investigated whether a 10-week martial arts training programme was an efficacious sports-based mental health intervention that promoted resilience in secondary school students. Sample: Two hundred and eighty-three secondary school students (age range 12‚Äì14¬†years) participated in the study. Methods: The study examined the effects of martial arts training on participants‚Äô resilience by delivering a 10-week martial arts-based intervention in secondary school settings. The intervention was evaluated using quantitative methodology and an experimental research design using a randomized controlled trial which measured participant responses at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. Results: The study found that the martial arts-based intervention had a significantly positive effect on developing students‚Äô resilience. This was especially apparent when the intervention and control group‚Äôs mean resilience outcomes were compared.

Gore J.; Rosser B.,Beyond content-focused professional development: powerful professional learning through genuine learning communities across grades and subjects,2022,"Articulations of effective teacher professional development (PD) consistently foreground a focus on curriculum content and how best to teach it. Consequently, when teachers work together on pedagogy they typically work with colleagues who have similar specialisations, focusing on a specific subject or part of the curriculum. Arguably, however, pedagogical practices cut across grades and subjects, which signals the possibility of effective PD that includes diverse teachers. In this paper, we analyse the impact of a pedagogy-focused approach to PD called Quality Teaching Rounds (QTR), recently tested under randomised controlled trial conditions. Drawing on post-intervention interviews with 96 teachers and leaders at 24 schools in NSW, Australia, we demonstrate that QTR generated fresh insights about pedagogy and students, enhanced collegiality and led to ongoing professional collaboration, even though it does not abide by the general consensus that effective PD should be content-focused. We argue that pedagogy-focused PD, using QTR, is an important mechanism for improving teaching on a large scale, not just for this grade or subject, but for teaching in general. With a global push for better teaching as foundational to improved student outcomes, building teaching capacity across the entire teacher workforce remains a challenge.

The primary aim of this study is to assess whether an enhanced implementation intervention increases adoption of the PAX Good Behaviour Game in New South Wales (NSW) primary schools in Australia. A secondary outcome is to investigate the impact of the PAX Good Behaviour Game on children's mental health in the Australian context. Methods and analysis: The study uses a cluster randomised hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation design and will involve 40 NSW primary schools. Randomisation will occur at the school level. All NSW primary schools trained in the PAX Good Behaviour Game are eligible for participation. The intervention is a multicomponent implementation strategy that has been iteratively co-designed by our research team and local stakeholders. Intervention schools will have access to eight implementation support strategies in addition to the training received as usual delivery to build knowledge and skills. Research staff will assess implementation and effectiveness outcomes using self-report online surveys with teachers and support staff at baseline, 6-weeks, 6-months and 12-months follow up. Semi-structured interviews with teachers and support staff will be used to examine which implementation strategies worked for whom and under what conditions.

Sexton E.T.S.; Sheehan J.; Van Dam N.T.; Grobler A.; Phillips L.; Yaari M.; Hiscock H.,Feasibility of the Early Minds Program by Smiling Mind: a Pilot Cluster-Randomized-Controlled Trial,2022,"Objectives: While there is increasing interest in mindfulness-informed programs to support preschooler social, emotional, and cognitive development, evaluation of feasibility and efficacy is required prior to implementing such programs within the early education setting. This study evaluated the feasibility of an 8-week, app-based, educator-delivered, mindfulness-informed program, Early Minds by Smiling Mind. An established framework was used to assess demand, acceptability, implementation, practicality, (adequate) adaptation, integration, and limited efficacy testing. Limited efficacy testing explored program use on preschoolers‚Äô internalizing, externalizing, prosocial behaviors, and executive function. Methods: A pilot cluster-randomized-controlled trial (CRCT) was conducted with 25 early learning educators and 188 preschoolers from six early learning centres (ELCs) in Melbourne, Australia. Post baseline data collection, ELC rooms were randomly allocated to the program (n = 5 rooms, 111 children) or usual care (n = 5 rooms, 77 children) group. Data was collected at baseline, 3-month, and 12-month post-randomization. Results: The Early Minds program did not meet feasibility on four of the seven educator-reported domains (implementation, practicality, adaptation, and limited efficacy testing) and showed mixed results for two of the seven domains (acceptability and integration). Parent-reported feasibility has not been established as too few parents used the program.

Guillen P.; Kesten O.; Kiefer A.; Melatos M.,A field evaluation of a matching mechanism: University applicant behavior in Australia,2022,"The majority of undergraduate university applications in the state of New South Wales‚ÄîAustralia‚Äôs largest state‚Äîare processed by a clearinghouse, the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC). Applicants submit an ordered list of degrees to the UAC, which applies a matching algorithm to allocate university places to eligible applicants. Applicants receive advice on how to construct their degree preference list from multiple sources including individual universities. This advice is often confusing and misleading. To evaluate the performance of the current system, we run a large sample (832 observations) online experiment with experienced participants in a choice environment that mimics the UAC application process, and in which truth telling is optimal. We vary the advice received across treatments: no advice, the UAC advice only, an instance of misleading university advice only, and both the UAC and the misleading university advice together. Overall, 75.5% of participants fail to behave in their best interest. High rates of applicant manipulation persist even when applicants are provided with the UAC‚Äôs accurate advice. Students who attend nonselective government high schools are more prone to use strictly dominated strategies than those who attend academically selective government high schools and private high schools. ¬©C The Author(s) 2022.",10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac010,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Something else,Something else,832,"The description does not provide specific information on whether the study showed statistically significant results.

Uddin M.; Wang L.C.; Smyth R.,Do government-initiated energy comparison sites encourage consumer search and lower prices? Evidence from an online randomized controlled experiment in Australia,2021,"We conduct an online randomized controlled experiment in Australia in order to examine whether government initiatives to encourage the use of energy comparison sites increase consumer search and result in lower prices. Despite significant price variations across energy retailers, our experiment indicates that while providing information about the potential gains from using the government-owned Victoria Energy Compare (VEC) website encourages participants to visit the website, it is not effective in inducing them to contact, or switch, retailers who are providing better offers. Moreover, low-income individuals who visited the VEC website due to the availability of a $50 bonus are less likely to contact retailers for a better deal in order to switch retailers, and end up paying a higher cost of per unit kWh electricity and spending more on total electricity expenditure. Our findings imply that promoting government-initiated comparison sites is not sufficient to increase competition and that providing consumers with financial incentives for using these sites in order to encourage competition and improve outcomes of the energy poor may potentially backfire. ¬© 2021",10.1016/j.jebo.2021.05.016,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Online randomized controlled experiment,The sample size is not given.,"The study did not show statistically significant results in terms of encouraging participants to contact or switch to retailers with better offers, despite visiting the government-owned Victoria Energy",Environment / energy; Public administration; Welfare
McGill N.; McLeod S.; Ivory N.; Davis E.; Rohr K.,Randomised Controlled Trial Evaluating Active versus Passive Waiting for Speech-Language Pathology,2021,"Introduction: High demand for speech-language pathology means children sometimes wait over 12 months for services, missing out on timely support. Waiting can be a time of stress, concern, and powerlessness for caregivers. Provision of information via a website may support families and encourage active waiting. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare children's speech, intelligibility, language, and literacy outcomes, and caregivers' satisfaction and empowerment in active versus passive waiting conditions. Methods: Ninety-seven preschool-aged children referred to a community health speech-language pathology service in Australia were screened for eligibility. Eligible children (n =42) with speech/language difficulties were randomly allocated to: (a) active waiting (provision of a purpose-built website; n = 20), or (b) passive waiting (control group; n = 22). Pre- and post-assessments (after 6 months on a waiting list) were completed with children and caregivers by a speech-language pathologist blinded to group allocations. Results: Intention to treat (n =36) and per-protocol analyses (n =30) were conducted to measure group differences in child and caregiver outcomes at post-assessment using one-way ANCOVA, controlling for baseline scores. There were no statistically significant differences between groups for children's speech, intelligibility, language, and literacy, or caregivers' empowerment and satisfaction. Children in both groups made minimal gains over 6 months. Conclusions: Provision of an active waiting website did not lead to statistically significant change in child or caregiver outcomes, and children in both groups made little progress over a 6-month period. Early speech-language pathology intervention delivered with appropriate dosage is needed to optimise children's outcomes. Until timely and effective speech-language pathology intervention can be provided for all who need it, provision of early assessments may be beneficial. There remains a need for effective ways to support children and families on waiting lists.  ¬© 2020 ",10.1159/000508830,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT),42,"No, the study did not show statistically significant results.

Whelan J.; Marshall H.; Sullivan T.R.,Intracluster correlation coefficients in a large cluster randomized vaccine trial in schools: Transmission and impact of shared characteristics,2021,"Cluster randomized trials (cRCT) to assess vaccine effectiveness incorporate indirect effects of vaccination, helping to inform vaccination policy. To calculate the sample size for a cRCT, an estimate of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) is required. For infectious diseases, shared characteristics and social mixing behaviours may increase susceptibility and exposure, promote transmission and be a source of clustering. We present ICCs from a school-based cRCT assessing the effectiveness of a meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero, GlaxoSmithKline) on reducing oropharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) in 34,489 adolescents from 237 schools in South Australia in 2017/2018. We also explore the contribution of shared behaviours and characteristics to these ICCs. The ICC for carriage of disease-causing Nm genogroups (primary outcome) pre-vaccination was 0.004 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.007) and for all Nm was 0.007 (95%CI: 0.004, 0.011). Adjustment for social behaviours and personal characteristics reduced the ICC for carriage of disease-causing and all Nm genogroups by 25% (to 0.003) and 43% (to 0.004), respectively. ICCs are also reported for risk factors here, which may be outcomes in future research. Higher ICCs were observed for susceptibility and/or exposure variables related to Nm carriage (having a cold, spending ‚â•1 night out socializing or kissing ‚â•1 person in the previous week). In metropolitan areas, nights out socializing was a highly correlated behaviour. By contrast, smoking was a highly correlated behaviour in rural areas. A practical example to inform future cRCT sample size estimates is provided. ¬© 2021 Whelan et al.

Objectives: A model of care based on Atraumatic Restorative Treatment and the Hall Technique (ART-HT) to manage ECC was evaluated among remote Aboriginal communities in Australia. Methods: Aboriginal communities in the North-West of Western Australia were invited to participate and consenting communities were randomized into early or delayed intervention for the management of ECC. Children were examined at baseline and at the 11-mo follow-up. The early intervention group (test) was provided with the ART-based dental care at baseline while the delayed intervention group (control) was advised to seek care through the usual care options available within the community. At follow-up, both groups were examined by calibrated examiners, and were offered care using the ART-HT approach. Changes from baseline to follow-up in caries experience were tested using paired tests. Multivariate analysis after multiple imputation of missing data used generalised estimating equation (GEE) controlling for clustering within communities. Results: A total of 25 communities and 338 children (mean age = 3.6 y, SD 1.7) participated in the study (test = 177). At follow-up, 231 children were examined (68% retention, test = 125). At follow-up, children in the test group had more filled teeth (test filled teeth = 1.2, control filled teeth = 0.2, P < 0.001) and decreased levels of decayed teeth (mean test = 0.7 fewer teeth with decay, mean control = 1.0 more tooth with decay, P < 0.001). GEE analysis controlled for baseline caries experience, age, sex, and community water fluoride levels found increased rates of untreated decayed teeth (RR = 1.4, P = 0.02) and decreased rates of filled teeth (RR = 0.2, P < 0.001) at follow-up among the control group. Conclusion: A model of care relying on the principles of minimally invasive atraumatic approaches enabled the delivery of effective dental services to young children (<6 y) in remote Aboriginal Australian communities resulting in increased levels of care and improved oral health. Knowledge Transfer Statement: This cluster-randomized trial tested a multi-component model of dental care to young children with ECC in remote Aboriginal communities in Australia. The intervention, based on the atraumatic approaches using minimally invasive techniques encompassing preventive care, Atraumatic Restorative Treatment and the Hall Technique (ART-HT), delivered more restorative care and reduced the incidence of caries. This model of care was more effective than available standard care and should be incorporated into mainstream service delivery programs. ¬© International & American Associations for Dental Research 2020.",10.1177/2380084420963949,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,338,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Haynes A.; Sherrington C.; Wallbank G.; Wickham J.; Tong A.; Kirkham C.; Manning S.; Ramsay E.; Tiedemann A.,Using self-determination theory to understand and improve recruitment for the Coaching for Healthy Ageing (CHAnGE) trial,2021,"Background Intervention trials promoting physical activity among older people frequently report low and unrepresentative recruitment. Better understanding of reasons for participation can help improve recruitment. This study explored why participants enrolled in the Coaching for Healthy Ageing (CHAnGE) trial, including how their decision was influenced by recruitment strategies. CHAnGE was a cluster randomised controlled trial testing the effectiveness of a healthy ageing program targeting inactivity and falls. Seventy-two groups of people aged 60 + were recruited from community organisations via informal presentations by the health coaches. Methods We conducted a secondary thematic analysis of interview data from our wider qualitative evaluation in which 32 purposively sampled trial participants took part in semi-structured interviews about their experiences of CHAnGE. Data relating to recruitment and participation were analysed inductively to identify themes, then a coding framework comprising the core constructs from self-determination theory‚Äîautonomy, competence and relatedness‚Äîwas used to explore if and how this theory fit with and helped to explain our data. Results Recruitment presentations promoted the CHAnGE intervention well in terms of addressing value expectations of structured support, different forms of accountability, credibility, achievability and, for some, a potential to enhance social relationships. Participation was motivated by the desire for improved health and decelerated ageing, altruism and curiosity. These factors related strongly to self-determination concepts of autonomy, competence and relatedness, but the intervention‚Äôs demonstrated potential to support self-determination needs could be conveyed more effectively. Conclusions Findings suggest that recruitment could have greater reach using: 1. Strengths-based messaging focusing on holistic gains, 2. Participant stories that highlight positive experiences, and 3. Peer support and information sharing to leverage altruism and curiosity. These theory-informed improvements will be used to increase participation in future trials, including people in hard-to-recruit groups. They may also inform other physical activity trials and community programs. Copyright: ¬© 2021 Haynes et al.

This study aimed to test the efficacy of SoMe, a social media literacy body image, dieting, and wellbeing program for adolescents, through a cluster randomized controlled trial. Participants (n = 892; Mage = 12.77, SD = 0.74; range 11‚Äì15; 49.5% male) were randomized by school (n = 8) to receive either weekly SoMe (n = 483) or control sessions (lessons as usual; n = 409) over 4 weeks in their classroom. Participants completed surveys at four timepoints (baseline, 1-week post-intervention, and 6-and 12-month follow-up) assessing body dissatisfaction, dietary restraint, strategies to increase muscles (primary outcomes), self-esteem and depressive symptoms (secondary outcomes), and internalization of appearance ideals and appearance comparison (exploratory outcomes). Modest positive intervention effects were found in dietary restraint and depressive symptoms at 6-month follow-up in girls but few positive effects emerged for boys. The findings provide only preliminary support for a social media literacy intervention, but suggest the usefulness of both identifying those who benefit most from a universally delivered intervention and the need to refine the intervention to maximize intervention effects. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

The study aim was to determine the effect of providing tailored feedback on the healthiness of students‚Äô lunch orders from a school canteen online ordering system. A cluster randomized controlled trial with ten government primary schools in New South Wales, Australia was conducted. Consenting schools that used an online canteen provider (‚ÄòFlexischools‚Äô) were randomized to either: a graph and prompt showing the proportion of ‚Äòeveryday‚Äô foods selected or a standard online ordering system. Students with an online lunch order during baseline data collection were included (n = 2200 students; n = 7604 orders). Primary outcomes were the proportion of foods classified as ‚Äòeveryday‚Äô or ‚Äòcaution‚Äô. Secondary outcomes included: mean energy, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium content. There was no difference over time between groups on the proportion of ‚Äòeveryday‚Äô (OR 0.99; p = 0.88) or ‚Äòcaution‚Äô items purchased (OR 1.17; p = 0.45).

However, few intervention trials have investigated how recreational infrastructure can be used to reduce inactivity levels in communities. The MOVE Frankston study aimed to assess the impact of low intensity strategies to promote use of a multi-purpose leisure and aquatic centre in a socioeconomically diverse, metropolitan community. This randomised controlled trial of two years‚Äô duration compared public awareness raising (control condition) with two interventions: mailed information about the centre and a free entry pass (I-O); and this minimal intervention supplemented by customer relations management support through telephone contact, mailed promotional materials and additional incentives (I+S). Participants (n = 1320) were inactive adults living in the City of Frankston, Melbourne Australia. There were 928 people (70.3%) followed up at 12 months (61.2% female, 52% ‚â•55 yrs). Compared with controls, attendance at the Centre once or more was higher in both the I-O (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.28‚Äì2.50) and I+S groups (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.03‚Äì2.07). The proportion of people using the centre weekly did not differ by group. The odds of being in contemplation or preparation to use the Centre were higher in both the I-O (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.28‚Äì2.42) and I+S groups (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.07‚Äì2.06). Total physical activity and related social and cognitive factors did not differ between the groups. The findings show that the low intensity promotional strategies prompted occasional attendance and increased readiness to use this recreational facility, a level of behaviour change unlikely to reduce non-communicable disease risk. It is recommended that more frequent customer relations contact, and involvement of healthcare providers, be tested as strategies to encourage inactive adults to take up physical activity opportunities at recreational facilities of this type. ¬© 2021 Smith et al.

The aim of this study is to examine whether an online interdisciplinary intervention that incorporates evidence-based strategies from the disciplines of Lifestyle Medicine and Positive Psychology improves measures of mental health and emotional wellness. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with a wait-list control (N = 425, aged 46.97 ¬± 14.5, 69.9% females) was conducted in Australia and New Zealand.

Whilst research provides evidence of their benefits, knowledge translation into practice has been challenging both in Australia and internationally. An opportunity to develop a granular understanding of factors driving successful implementation was presented by the Pharmacy Diabetes Screening Trial (PDST), a clustered Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) implemented in a random sample of 339 Australian community pharmacies. Its aim was to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of three pharmacy-based diabetes screening interventions. Objective: To investigate the experiences of Australian community pharmacists in the implementation of the PDST and factors influencing implementation success. Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with a stratified sample of pharmacist trial participants based on screening performance (number screened relative to target), location, and trial arm. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed ad verbatim. Interviews were continued until saturation. Initial thematic analysis was followed by in-depth analysis to test the extent to which the data fitted with three previously described overarching themes driving successful national implementation of innovation in community pharmacy. Results: From August 2017 to October 2017, 21 interviews were conducted; 12 with high-performing and 9 with low-performing pharmacists. The key enablers and barriers were qualities of a pharmacy champion and active staff engagement, ease of implementation related to the number of working pharmacists and other staff, the external context including engagement with consumers and doctors, and consumer demand.

Clare J.; Henstock D.; McComb C.; Newland R.; Barnes G.C.,The results of a randomized controlled trial of police body-worn video in Australia,2021,"Objectives: We report the results of a randomized controlled trial of police body-worn video (BWV) cameras in an Australian context, with a focus on how cameras influence evidence gathering, court processes/outcomes, and police/public behavior. Methods: The 6-month trial undertaken by the Western Australia Police Force involved a sample of officers (N = 498) acting as their own controls with camera use (‚Äútreatment‚Äù) randomly allocated across shifts. A range of parametric and non-parametric tests were conducted to explore the influence of BWV on interview efficiency, rate/timing of guilty pleas, conviction rates, sanction rates, police use-of-force, assaults against police, and citizen complaints against police. Results: The trial generated mixed results in support of this technology within this Australian context. BWV recordings did result in evidence-gathering benefits by producing cost/time efficiencies when taking field interviews. BWV footage had limited impact on court processes/outcomes, with indication that camera evidence encouraged earlier guilty pleas but no corresponding increase in the rate of guilty pleas or convictions. BWV did influence police operational decision-making, with increased sanction rates and use-of-force on treatment days. The extent to which officers engaged with the trial compounded these patterns. There was no evidence that BWV prevents problem behavior, with citizens‚Äô complaints increasing on treatment days and no influence of BWV on rates of assaults against police. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for additional context-specific clarity about why police use BWV cameras. In particular, BWV users should clearly specify the causal mechanisms through which cameras will achieve administrative, evidentiary, operational, and/or problem-prevention goals. ¬© 2019, The Author(s).",10.1007/s11292-019-09387-w,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,498,The study showed mixed results regarding the impact of police body-worn video (BWV) cameras.

Design/methodology/approach: This study sought to recruit 824 ex-smokers from 2 smoke-free prisons in the Northern Territory, Australia. Participants were randomised to receive either one session (45‚Äì60 min) face-to-face MI intervention 4‚Äì6 weeks prior to release or usual care (UC) without smoking advice. The primary outcome was continuous smoking abstinence verified by exhaled carbon monoxide test (<5 ppm) at three months post-release. Secondary outcomes included seven-day point-prevalence, time to the first cigarette and the daily number of cigarettes smoked after release. Findings: From April 2017 to March 2018, a total of 557 participants were randomised to receive the MI (n = 266) or UC (n = 291), with 75% and 77% being followed up, respectively. There was no significant between-group difference in continuous abstinence (MI 8.6% vs UC 7.4%, risk ratio = 1.16, 95%CI 0.67‚àº2.03). Of all participants, 66.9% relapsed on the day of release and 90.2% relapsed within three months. On average, participants in the MI group smoked one less cigarette daily than those in the UC within the three months after release (p < 0.01). Research limitations/implications: A single-session of MI is insufficient to reduce relapse after release from a smoke-free prison. However, prison release remains an appealing time window to build on the public health benefit of smoke-free prisons. Further research is needed to develop both pre- and post-release interventions that provide continuity of care for relapse prevention. Originality/value: This study is the first Australian randomised controlled trial to evaluate a pre-release MI intervention on smoking relapse prevention amongst people released from smoke-free prisons. ¬© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/IJPH-01-2020-0003,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,824,The study did not show statistically significant results in continuous smoking abstinence between the motivational interview (MI) group and the usual care (UC) group.,Health; Justice; Drugs and alcohol

In many countries, including Australia, physical activity (i.e. physical education and school sport) is not mandatory in the final two¬†years of high school (i.e. senior school years). The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a time-efficient physical activity intervention on senior school students‚Äô on-task behaviour and subjective vitality. This was a sub-study of the Burn 2 Learn (B2L) cluster randomised controlled trial, which included two cohorts. Participants for this sub-study (N = 221) were from 10 secondary schools (23 classes) located in New South Wales, Australia (Cohort 2). Teachers allocated to the B2L intervention group were provided with training, resources and support to facilitate the delivery of two high-intensity activity breaks per week during lesson time for five¬†weeks. A wait-list control was used as comparison group. On-task behaviour was assessed at baseline and post-test, using a momentary time sampling procedure and expressed as a percentage of lesson time. At post-test, subjective vitality was assessed at the start and end of the lesson using a validated questionnaire. Significant group-by-time effects were observed for students‚Äô on-task behaviour in favour of the B2L group [adjusted mean difference = 19.3% of lesson time (95% CI, 0.8 to 37.8), p = 0.042, d = 0.43].

This study evaluated the effect of two intensities of teacher training on the evaluation of a vegetable education program for Australian primary schools by teachers. The teachers (n = 65) who implemented the program as part of a cluster RCT (25 schools in two states, New South Wales and South Australia) received either low-(provision with materials and online training) or high (additional face-to-face (F2F) training)-intensity training prior to implementing a 5-week vegetable education program. They evaluated the acceptability of a digital training module and program by indicating the level of agreement with 15 and 18 statements, respectively, using 5-point Likert scales. The average item scores ranged from 3.0 to 4.2. All but one item, including student engagement, alignment to the curriculum and intent for reuse of the program, had a rounded average or median score of 4. The level of training intensity did not impact the teacher acceptability ratings. In conclusion, the teacher acceptability was good, and additional F2F training does not add value above the solely digital training of the teachers. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

Methods: A two-group, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with crossover was conducted involving 13 students with ASD (9 males, aged 7.6 to 8.4 years) and 17 typically progressing students without ASD (7 males, aged 7.6 to 9.3 years) from 10 primary schools in and near to Brisbane, Australia. Eighteen of these children had an SFA system in their classrooms in semester one and 12 in semester two of their fourth year of formal schooling (Year 3). Potential proximate benefits were assessed using teacher questionnaire and video analysis of student listening behaviours. Potential distant benefits were assessed using measures of phonological processing in quiet and in noise, attention, memory, and educational achievement. Results: Potential proximate benefits were observed for all students with teachers rating student listening behaviours higher with SFA versus without SFA. Potential distant benefits were observed for students with ASD who showed greater improvements in one area of phonological processing (blending nonsense words in noise) following SFA versus no SFA. No other potential proximate or distant benefits following SFA were observed. Conclusions: SFA could be used as an inclusive classroom adjustment to support some primary school students with and without ASD by potentially putting those students in a better position to learn, but their learning must still take place over time and realistic expectations of what can reasonably be achieved by SFA alone are needed. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.jcomdis.2021.106142,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,"A two-group, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with crossover",30,"The study observed potential proximate benefits for all students, with teachers rating student listening behaviors higher with SFA versus without SFA.

Adult male prisoners were recruited for a 16-week randomised control trial comparing the effect of ingestion of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) and multivitamin supplements versus placebo on aggressive behaviour. The baseline and post-intervention assessments from the participant blood samples were the erythrocyte n-3 LCPUFA levels as well as measures of aggressive behaviour determined through institutional records of misconduct (IRM), the Inmate Behaviour Observation Scale (IBOS), and questionnaires. A total of 136 adult male prisoners consented to the study with a retention rate of 60%, and 93% of blood samples were successfully collected. The IRM and IBOS scores were collected for 100% of participants, whilst 82‚Äì97% of participants completed the questionnaires. From the baseline data, the Odds Ratio shows that prisoners are 4.3 times more likely to have an IBOS >2 if they are below the 6% cut off on the omega-3 index. Both groups improved across all outcome measures and, at the current sample size, no significant differences were seen between them. A power calculation suggests a total sample size of 600 participants is required to detect the effects of this dietary supplementation, and that this supplementation study is feasible in a Correctional Centre.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a Vegetable Education Resource To Increase Children‚Äôs Acceptance and Liking (VERTICAL) for Australian primary schools (curriculum aligned and based on a framework of food preference development and sensory experiential learning) on positively influencing factors predisposing children towards increased vegetable consumption. The secondary aim was to evaluate two levels of teacher training intensity on intervention effectiveness.

By increasing knowledge and skills, peers may act as gatekeepers to mental health services. The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of a brief sports-based mental health literacy program to increase competencies and intentions to both provide and seek help for mental health problems among adolescent male sports participants. A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted with measures taken at 3 time points: baseline (2 weeks prior to intervention), immediately postintervention, and at 1-month follow-up. Adolescents were randomized to either the intervention group (n = 47) or a waitlist control group (n = 55) at a team level (n teams = 9). Participants were 102 male adolescents 12‚Äì18 years of age (M = 14.30, SD = 1.75) from a community football club in New South Wales, Australia. A 45-min Help Out a Mate (HOAM) workshop was delivered around a usual team practice session. Compared to the waitlist control, participants in the HOAM condition reported significant increases in knowledge of signs and symptoms of mental illness, intentions to provide help to a friend who may be experiencing a mental health problem, and attitudes that promote problem recognition and help-seeking. There were no between-group differences in confidence to provide help, personal help-seeking intentions, and psychological distress. The results suggest that a brief intervention can be effective at improving the mental health literacy of young men when delivered within a sports context. Lay summary: Compared to a waitlist control, the Help Out a Mate group showed improvements in mental health literacy for depression and anxiety and intentions to provide help along with sustained improvements in attitudes that promote help-seeking and reduce stigma.

Interventions that reduce these harms could avert significant suffering and healthcare costs. Objectives: The Discharge Medications Reconciliation (DCMedsRec) trial will evaluate a structured medication reconciliation service by community pharmacists post hospital discharge on the risk of 30-day unplanned readmission. Electronic access to the Hospital Discharge Summary via My Health Record will underpin this service. Methods: DCMedsRec is a non-blinded randomised controlled trial of an intervention by community pharmacists within 30 days of hospital discharge in Melbourne, Australia. Patients discharged from hospital will be assessed by a hospital pharmacist for trial eligibility. If eligible, patients will be randomised to either a control or intervention group by sequentially marked sealed envelopes. Intervention patients receive an invitation to the DCMedsRec service at a participating community pharmacy, who will be reimbursed. Control patients will receive usual care. A Number Needed to Treat of 20 will require 293 DCMedsRec interventions to achieve 80% power. With a predicted 30% uptake, a minimum sample of 977 in the intervention arm is required. Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the rate of 30-day unplanned hospital readmission in intervention (DCMedsRec) versus usual care groups. Secondary analyses will evaluate the economic impact of the intervention and a qualitative thematic analysis of the experience and value of the service for both patients and service providers (community pharmacists). Analysis: An intention-to-treat analysis will be used to assess intervention efficacy and results will be reported using risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Cost-effectiveness analysis will compare within-trial costs and outcomes of the DCMedsRec versus usual care from a health-system perspective.

Dollard M.F.; Bailey T.,Building Psychosocial Safety Climate in Turbulent Times: The Case of COVID-19,2021,"Our theoretically driven cluster-randomized cohort control study sought to understand how psychosocial safety climate (PSC)‚Äîa climate to protect worker psychological health‚Äîcould be built in different organizational change scenarios. We drew on event system theory to characterize change (planned vs. shock) as an event (observable, bounded in time and space, nonroutine) to understand how events connect and impact organizational behavior and features (e.g., job design, PSC). Event 1 was an 8-month planned intervention involving training middle managers to enact PSC in work units and reduce job stressors. Event 2 was the shock COVID-19 pandemic which occurred midintervention (at 4 months). Three waves (T1, 0 months; T2, 4 months; T3, 8 months) of data were collected from experimental (295T1, 224T2, 119T3) and control (236T1, 138T2, 83T3) employees across 22 work groups. Multilevel analysis showed in Event 1 (T1T2) a significant Group √ó Time effect where PSC (particularly management priority) significantly increased in the experimental versus control group. Under Event 2 (T2T3), PSC was maintained at higher levels in the experimental versus control group but both groups reported significantly increased PSC communication and commitment. Results suggest that middle management training increases PSC within 4 months. Event 2, COVID-19 was shocking and its novelty, disruption, criticality, and timing in Australian industrial history enabled a strong top management response, positively affecting the control group. PSC may be sustained and built in times of shock with top management will, the application of PSC principles, and a top-level pro-psychological health agenda. ¬© 2021 American Psychological Association",10.1037/apl0000939,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,"295T1, 224T2, 119T3 for the","Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Dixon H.; Scully M.; Wakefield M.; Kelly B.; Pettigrew S.; Chapman K.; Niederdeppe J.,Can counter-advertising protect spectators of elite sport against the influence of unhealthy food and beverage sponsorship? A naturalistic trial,2020,"Rationale and objective: Unhealthy, energy-dense nutrient-poor foods and beverages are heavily promoted through sport sponsorship. This naturalistic trial assessed whether exposing young adult spectators to various types of counter-advertising (CA) before watching an unhealthy food sponsored elite sporting event could diminish sponsorship effects and increase support for restrictions on sponsorship. Method: Young adults (ages 18-29 years) who planned to watch the Australian Football League (AFL) Grand Final were recruited through an online panel and randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (A) control (neutral advertisement); (B) anti-industry CA (critiquing unhealthy food industry sponsorship of sport); (C) anti-product CA (critiquing the association of sports stars with unhealthy food); or (D) negative health effects CA (highlighting negative health consequences of unhealthy food consumption). Participants (N = 1316) completed a pre-test questionnaire and viewed their assigned CA online 1‚Äì3 days before watching the 2017 AFL Grand Final, which featured unhealthy food sponsorship. Results: Participants who reported watching the AFL Grand Final (n = 802) answered post-test measures within five days of the event. Results indicated that participants found the anti-industry CA more believable, attention-grabbing, reassuring and encouraging than the anti-product CA. The anti-industry CA promoted less favourable attitudes to sponsor brands, the anti-product CA promoted reduced intentions to purchase the fast-food sponsor brand, and the negative health effects CA reduced preferences for fast food in general compared to the control condition. Conclusions: Anti-industry CA may detract from favourable attitudes to unhealthy food sponsor brands and negative health effects CA may detract from intentions to consume fast food in the face of unhealthy food sponsorship exposure. Such interventions may require higher dosage levels than applied in the present study to bolster spectators‚Äô resistance to the surfeit of unhealthy food sport sponsorship. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113415,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,1316,"The study showed that the anti-industry counter-advertising was more effective in promoting less favorable attitudes towards sponsor brands, while the anti-product counter-ad",Health; Nutrition; Business

Objective: To investigate how exposure to different marketing techniques from television (TV) and online food advertising affects children's brand recall, recognition, and attitudinal responses toward brands and brand consumers and children's desire to eat the advertised products. Design: Secondary analysis of data from a crossover experimental-control study. Participants/setting: In all, 154 children (7 to 12 years) completed the study, conducted at four 6-day holiday camps from April 2016 to January 2017 in New South Wales, Australia. Children were assigned to a single-media (n=76) or multiple-media (n=78) condition. Intervention: All children viewed 10 TV food advertisements in a cartoon on three occasions. For one of the brands, one set of children additionally played online ‚Äúadvergames‚Äù featuring the brand. Main outcome measures: Children's recognition and attitudes toward brands and brand consumers and children's desire to eat the product were reported via a brand recognition and attitude survey pre- and postintervention. Marketing techniques were categorized. Statistical analysis: Pre- and postintervention brand recognition and relationships between brand recognition and attitudes by media condition and desire to eat the product were examined using generalized linear mixed models and linear mixed models. Results: There was a significant increase in the number of brands recognized postexposure by children in both media groups (mean difference=3.8, P<0.0001). The majority of brands appealed to children. Children who reported wanting to eat the advertised products rated brands more positively than children who did not express a desire to eat the products. A larger proportion of children who played the advergames (36%) rated brand consumers as ‚Äúcool‚Äù than children who viewed the TV advertisements only (19%) (P<0.001). Anti-adult themes, fun and humor, and parent pleasing were techniques unique to some of the most recognized and favored advertisements. Conclusions: The marketing communications increased children's brand recognition and elicited positive attitudinal responses. These findings indicate a need for policy makers to consider additional regulations to protect children from the persuasive influence of unhealthy food advertising. ¬© 2020 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics",10.1016/j.jand.2019.05.006,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,154,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Gillitzer C.; Sinning M.,Nudging businesses to pay their taxes: Does timing matter?,2020,"This paper provides empirical evidence on the implications of the timing of reminders by studying the effect of varying the timing of reminder letters to taxpayers on their payment behavior. The collection of unpaid tax debts constitutes a considerable challenge for tax authorities. We discuss potential mechanisms through which reminders may affect taxpayers‚Äô behavior and study the payment behavior of business taxpayers in a field experiment in Australia. We find that a simple reminder letter increases the probability of payment by about 25 percentage points relative to a control group that does not receive a letter from the tax authority. However, variation over a three-week period in the timing of the reminder letter has no effect on the probability of payment within seven weeks of the due date.

Children prenatally exposed to alcohol or early life trauma (ELT) are at higher risk of impairment of these skills and may require intervention to address self-regulation deficits. Researchers partnered with the local Aboriginal health organization and schools to develop and pilot a manualized version of the Alert Program¬Æ in the Fitzroy Valley, north Western Australia, a region with documented high rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and ELT. This self-controlled cluster randomized trial evaluated the effect of an 8-week Alert Program¬Æ intervention on children‚Äôs executive functioning and self-regulation skills.

Teachers from 26 primary school classrooms across eight Fitzroy Valley schools received training to deliver eight, one-hour Alert Program¬Æ lessons over eight-weeks to students. Student outcomes were measured by parent and teacher ratings of children‚Äôs behavioral, emotional, and cognitive regulation. The mean number of lessons attended by children was 4.2. Although no significant improvements to children‚Äôs executive functioning skills or behavior were detected via the teacher-rated measures as hypothesized, statistically significant improvements were noted on parent-rated measures of executive functioning and behavior. The effectiveness of future self-regulation programs may be enhanced through multimodal delivery through home, school and community based settings to maximize children‚Äôs exposure to the intervention. Despite mixed findings of effect, this study was an important first step in adapting and evaluating the Alert Program¬Æ for use in remote Australian Aboriginal community schools, where access to self-regulation interventions is limited. ¬© 2020 Wagner et al.

Rodda S.N.; Bagot K.L.; Manning V.; Lubman D.I.,An Exploratory RCT to Support Gamblers‚Äô Intentions to Stick to Monetary Limits: A Brief Intervention Using Action and Coping Planning,2020,"The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and impact of an action and coping planning intervention deployed in gambling venues to improve adherence to expenditure limits. We conducted a 2-group parallel-block randomised controlled trial comparing one 20-min session of action and coping planning to an assessment alone. Gamblers who were intending to set a monetary limit on EGMs (n = 184) were recruited in venues and administered the intervention prior to gambling. Measures were adherence to self-identified gambling limits and adherence to expenditure intentions at 30-days post-intervention using the Time Line Follow-Back. The intervention was feasible in terms of recruitment and willingness of gamblers to engage in a pre-gambling intervention. Most gamblers enacted strategies to limit their gambling prior to entering the venue, albeit these limits were on average higher than the Australian low risk gambling guidelines. In terms of impact, the intervention did not improve adherence to limits at post or 30-day follow-up assessment. However, Moderate Risk/Problem Gamblers in the Intervention group spent less (a median of $60 less) than intended (median $100) within the venue. All intervention participants intended to spend significantly less in the 30¬†days after the intervention compared to the amount spent in the 30¬†days prior to the intervention. This reduction was not found for participants in the control group. A simple brief intervention appears feasible in gambling venues and have an impact on gambling intentions over the short term. ¬© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10899-019-09873-w,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,184,"The study did not show statistically significant results in improving adherence to gambling limits at post or 30-day follow-up assessment.

The aim of the OPTIMISE randomised trial was to evaluate the effect of dietary and exercise advice among pregnant women of normal body mass index (BMI), on pregnancy and birth outcomes. The trial was conducted in Adelaide, South Australia. Pregnant women with a body mass index in the healthy weight range (18.5‚Äì24.9 kg/m2) were enrolled in a randomised controlled trial of a dietary and lifestyle intervention versus standard antenatal care.

Scully M.; Morley B.; Wakefield M.; Dixon H.,Can point-of-sale nutrition information and health warnings encourage reduced preference for sugary drinks?: An experimental study,2020,"Point-of-sale (POS) interventions that prompt consumers to more critically evaluate sugary drinks could encourage reduced consumption of these drinks and reinforce public health campaign messages. This study tested whether: (i) POS nutrition information and health warnings about sugary drinks promote healthier drink choices and (ii) impacts of prominent POS signs on drink choices vary based on participants‚Äô self-reported prior exposure to a sugary drink public health campaign. In an online experiment, 3034 Australian adults aged 18‚Äì59 years who were past-week sugary drink consumers were randomly assigned to one of five POS signage conditions (no signage (control); sugar content of specific beverages; Health Star Rating of specific beverages; generic text health warning about sugary drinks; generic graphic health warning about sugary drinks) and shown their randomly assigned POS sign alone, then alongside a drinks product display and asked to select which drink they would choose to buy. The proportion selecting a sugary drink was significantly lower among participants who viewed either the sugar content (29%), Health Star Rating (33%) or graphic health warning (34%) signs compared to those who saw no sign (43%). These effects held for participants who did not recall previously seeing the campaign; however, for participants with self-reported prior exposure to the campaign, POS signs did not promote significant reductions in sugary drink choices. POS signage has the potential to shift consumers away from choosing sugary drinks and could complement mass media campaigns by reaching people who may not otherwise be exposed to sugary drink public health messages. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.appet.2020.104612,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Regular RCT,3034,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Estai M.; Kanagasingam Y.; Mehdizadeh M.; Vignarajan J.; Norman R.; Huang B.; Spallek H.; Irving M.; Arora A.; Kruger E.; Tennant M.,Teledentistry as a novel pathway to improve dental health in school children: A research protocol for a randomised controlled trial,2020,"Background: Despite great improvement in child oral health, some children subgroups still suffer from higher levels of dental caries. Geographic and socioeconomic barriers and the lack of access to dental care services are among common reasons for poor oral health in children. Historically in Australia, oral health therapists or dental therapists have been responsible for providing dental care for school children through the School Dental Services (SDS). The current SDS has been unable to provide sustainable dental care to all school children due to a reduction in workforce participation and limited resources. We propose a paradigm shift in the current service through the introduction of user-friendly technology to provide a foundation for sustainable dental care for school children. Methods/design: We describe an ongoing parallel, two-Armed, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial that compares routine and teledental pathway of dental care in children aged 4-15 years (n = 250). Participating schools in Western Australia will be randomly assigned to the control or teledental group, approximately three schools in each group with a maximum of 45 children in each school. All participants will first receive a standard dental examination to identify those who require urgent referrals and then their teeth will be photographed using a smartphone camera. At the baseline, children in the control group will receive screening results and advice on the pathway of dental care based on the visual dental screening while children in the teledental group will receive screening results based on the assessment of dental images. At 9 months follow-up, all participants will undergo a final visual dental screening. The primary outcomes include decay experience and proportion of children become caries active. The secondary outcomes include the diagnostic performance of photographic dental assessment and costs comparison of two pathways of dental care. Discussion: The current project seeks to take advantage of mobile technology to acquire dental images from a child's mouth at school settings and forwarding images electronically to an offsite dental practitioner to assess and prepare dental recommendations remotely. Such an approach will help to prioritise high-risk children and provide them with a quick treatment pathway and avoid unnecessary referrals or travel.

Cardwell S.M.; Mazerolle L.; Piquero A.R.,Parental attachment and truant rationalizations of antisocial behavior: findings from a randomized controlled trial,2020,"Theorists propose that young people are likely to offend when they rationalize antisocial behavior and that pro-social attachments to parents might modify this relationship. This research first assesses whether or not a truancy reduction program is able to modify the effects of a young person‚Äôs rationalizations on antisocial behavior and then explores if parental attachments impact this relationship. Data are from the Ability School Engagement Program (ASEP), a third-party policing intervention designed to reduce truancy and crime by increasing parental knowledge of education laws in a sample of 102 high truanting youth from Brisbane, Australia. The conferences also incoorporated restorative and reintegrative shaming practices, which have previously been theorized to impact rationalizing behaviors. We find that post-intervention measures of rationalizations are positively related to self-reported antisocial behavior for those in the experimental condition. The impact of rationalizations on antisocial behavior varied at different levels of parental attachment only for the experimental group, as the effect of rationalizations on antisocial behavior became stronger at higher levels of parental attachments. We conclude that those in the experiment with strong parental attachments may have used more rationalizations to engage in antisocial behavior to overcome some of the pro-social effects of the ASEP intervention. ¬© 2019, ¬© 2019 Midwestern Criminal Justice Association.",10.1080/0735648X.2019.1668825,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,102,"The study found that post-intervention measures of rationalizations were positively related to self-reported antisocial behavior for those in the experimental condition.

Moore B.; Dudley D.; Woodcock S.,The effects of martial arts participation on mental and psychosocial health outcomes: A randomised controlled trial of a secondary school-based mental health promotion program,2019,"Background: Mental health problems are a significant social issue that have multiple consequences, including broad social and economic impacts. However, many individuals do not seek assistance for mental health problems. Limited research suggests martial arts training may be an efficacious sports-based mental health intervention that potentially provides an inexpensive alternative to psychological therapy. Unfortunately, the small number of relevant studies and other methodological problems lead to uncertainty regarding the validity and reliability of existing research. This study aims to examine the efficacy of a martial arts based therapeutic intervention to improve mental health outcomes. Methods/design: The study is a 10-week secondary school-based intervention and will be evaluated using a randomised controlled trial. Data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 12-week follow-up. Power calculations indicate a maximum sample size of n = 293 is required. The target age range of participants is 11-14 years, who will be recruited from government and catholic secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. The intervention will be delivered in a face-to-face group format onsite at participating schools and consists of 10 √ó 50-60 min sessions, once per week for 10 weeks. Quantitative outcomes will be measured using standardised psychometric instruments. Discussion: The current study utilises a robust design and rigorous evaluation process to explore the intervention's potential efficacy. As previous research examining the training effects of martial arts participation on mental health outcomes has not exhibited comparable scale or rigour, the findings of the study will provide valuable evidence regarding the efficacy of martial arts training to improve mental health outcomes.

However, it is possible that these intervention programs may have an indirect impact on adolescent functioning via positive mediators, and that this influence may predict more durable protective benefits. This study evaluated the efficacy of the Resilient Families program for improving social-emotional skills and depressive symptoms for adolescents over a two-year period. Twenty-four secondary schools in Melbourne, Australia were randomly allocated to either Resilient Families or a control condition. 1826 students (M= 12.3, SD =.05 years at W1; 56% female) completed the curricula and subsequent surveys. Inconsistent with hypotheses, analysis with Structural Equation Modelling revealed that the program had no significant effect on social-emotional skills and these skills had no significant effects on adolescent depressive symptoms. However, family attendance at parent education events within the intervention schools was associated with longitudinal reductions in depressive symptoms. The findings highlight the importance of increasing emphasis on family and community protective factors in adolescent social-emotional development and depression prevention programs. ¬© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10964-019-00992-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,1826,The study did not show statistically significant results for the effect of the Resilient Families program on social-emotional skills or depressive symptoms in adolescents.

Wright K.M.; Roberts R.; Proeve M.J.,Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) for Prevention of Internalizing Difficulties: a Small Randomized Controlled Trial with Australian Primary School Children,2019,"Objectives: The use of mindfulness-based programs (MBP) with children is rapidly growing, but calls for well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of existing programs. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) has preliminary evidence for targeting internalizing symptoms in children. Within MBCT-C (and MBPs more broadly), attention is thought to be a key component of change, but mediation has been relatively unexplored. The overall aim of this small RCT was to compare MBCT-C to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), as a preventive program for children experiencing internalizing difficulties. Methods: A mixed factorial design was used, with 2 (program group) by 2 (pre- and post-intervention) conditions. Children from 3 primary schools were randomized to MBCT-C (n = 45) or CBT (n = 44) using random permuted blocks, with stratification by school, gender, and age. Main analyses were multi-level mixed models. Results: Contrary to the hypotheses, only limited differences were found between programs. Both programs had small effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression, quality of life, attention control, and parent- and teacher-SDQ Total Difficulties, as well as moderate-large effects on shifting attention. There were no statistically significant changes in mindfulness or sustained attention. Conclusions: This RCT provides a robust test of MBCT-C in a ‚Äúreal life‚Äù setting, demonstrating that it may be used as a clinically oriented preventive program in schools to reduce internalizing symptoms. The results challenge whether attention (as measured in this study) is a unique component of change for MBCT-C. ¬© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s12671-019-01193-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Full study with results.,Field experiment,A regular RCT,89,"The study did not show statistically significant results.

Prospective parents would like more information during pregnancy to prepare them for parenting, and need access to trusted and quality information. The Royal Women's Hospital (the Women's) in Melbourne, Australia, a large tertiary referral maternity hospital, developed a parenting education kit known as 'Growing Together'. The kit, designed to guide prospective and new parents from conception until 1 year after birth, includes three components: an A4 sized book, a specifically designed 'App' and a children's story book. We aim to evaluate the impact of the kit on a range of outcomes. Methods: A two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial will be used. Antenatal clinic days will be randomised to either the intervention or standard care arms. Women in the intervention arm receive the kit at their antenatal booking visit. Women in the standard care arm receive the standard information resources at the Women's. Analyses will be by intention to treat. Inclusion criteria: primiparous women with adequate English-speaking ability and ‚â§ 30 weeks' gestation at first pregnancy booking appointment. The primary outcome of the study is the 'experience of motherhood questionnaire' (EMQ), a 20 item validated self-report measure, ranging from 0 to 80, with lower scores indicating better maternal health and wellbeing. To detect a 10% difference in new mothers scoring ‚â§40 between women who have received the kit (60%) and those who have not (50%), would require 408 per group (total of 816 women) with 95% confidence and 80% power. Allowing for loss to follow up, we aim to recruit 1000 mothers. Secondary outcomes include parents' views and experiences of their care and of the kit during pregnancy and after the birth, parental attachment, knowledge, confidence, wellbeing and health-seeking behaviour; and emotional, developmental and physical health of the infant. Survey data will be collected from mothers at 2, 6 and 12 months postpartum and partners at 6 months.

Changes in actual store sales, from the pre-discount baseline period, were analysed for population impact on consumption of fruit and vegetables, water and artificially sweetened soft drinks, in addition with total dietary weight (grams), energy (Mega Joules), and sodium (milligrams). Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), arising from changes in dietary risk factor prevalence in the population, were estimated as the primary health outcome in a multi health-state Markov model. The costs of the strategies were sourced from paid invoices and time estimates of staff providing store-based discount promotion and consumer education. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio adopted a partial societal perspective, (including health and retail sector costs), as cost per DALY averted and was presented in 2011 Australian dollars. The price discount, helped address a gap in food price equity for residents of remote communities. However, the discount strategy, with or without consumer education led to a net loss of population health -36 95%CI (-47,-25) or -21(-28, -15) DALYs respectively, at increased cost to the retail and health sectors, of AUD860000 95%CI (710000, 1million) or AUD500000 (410000, 590000). The strategies trialled were thereby categorised as dominated by current practice while acknowledging considerable uncertainty surrounding the health outcome estimates. The 20% discount on limited targeted products appeared to need to be considered in conjunction with other marketing strategies to support healthy food choices, if remote Australian Indigenous population health is to be improved. ¬© 2018 Magnus et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0204005,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,The sample size is not given.,"The study did not show statistically significant results in terms of improving population health.

Goldfeld S.; Price A.; Kemp L.,"Designing, testing, and implementing a sustainable nurse home visiting program: Right@home",2018,"Nurse home visiting (NHV) offers a potential platform to both address the factors that limit access to services for families experiencing adversity and provide effective interventions. Currently, the ability to examine program implementation is hampered by a lack of detailed description of actual, rather than expected, program development and delivery in published studies. Home visiting implementation remains a black box in relation to quality and sustainability. However, previous literature would suggest that efforts to both report and improve program implementation are vital for NHV to have population impact and policy sustainability. In this paper, we provide a case study of the design, testing, and implementation of the right@home program, an Australian NHV program and randomized controlled trial. We address existing gaps related to implementation of NHV programs by describing the processes used to develop the program to be trialed, summarizing its effectiveness, and detailing the quality processes and implementation evaluation. The weight of our evidence suggests that NHV can be a powerful and sustainable platform for addressing inequitable outcomes, particularly when the program focuses on parent engagement and partnership, delivers evidence-based strategies shown to improve outcomes, includes fidelity monitoring, and is adapted to and embedded within existing service delivery systems. ¬© 2018 The Authors.",10.1111/nyas.13688,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomized controlled trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,"The description does not provide specific information about statistically significant results or detailed outcomes of the study.

Background: The phenomenon of a growing ageing population increases the demand of optimum care for older people living in aged care facilities. Caring for older people is complex, but should include the management of aggressive interaction between them. Nursing staff play a vital role in identifying and managing those behaviours. However, many nurses may not recognise these aggressive interactions as abuse. Therefore, this study aims to manage and reduce this abuse through an educational programme. Design: Cluster randomised trial registered on the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12617001618347). Methods: This trial was undertaken in an aged care facility located in Melbourne, Australia and was funded in January 2017. Wards were randomly allocated (as the intervention and control group) by using sealed opaque envelopes. Nursing staff, who met eligibility, were consecutively recruited and supplied their informed consent. Nurses from the intervention group received an educational programme, while nurses from the control group continued with the usual standard care.

Billich N.; Blake M.R.; Backholer K.; Cobcroft M.; Li V.; Peeters A.,"The effect of sugar-sweetened beverage front-of-pack labels on drink selection, health knowledge and awareness: An online randomised controlled trial",2018,"Purpose and aim: Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) provide little nutritional value and are associated with an increased risk of diet-related diseases. Despite this, SSB consumption is high globally. One emerging strategy aimed at reducing SSB consumption involves the use of front-of-pack (FOP) labels that clearly identify the risks associated with SSB consumption. The aim of this research study was to determine whether FOP labels with a graphic warning, text warning, sugar information (with the number of teaspoons of added sugar) or Health Star Rating (HSR) reduces intended choice of a SSB in an online choice experiment with young Australian adults. Results: 994 participants were recruited and completed the online choice experiment. Compared to the control group who were not exposed to a label, the graphic warning, text warning, sugar information and HSR labels all significantly reduced selection of a SSB in the choice scenario. The magnitude of effect was greatest for the graphic warning label (OR 0.22 95% CI 0.14‚Äì0.35). Compared to the control group, only the HSR label significantly increased selections of the high HSR drinks (OR 2.18 95% CI 1.20‚Äì3.97). Conclusions: FOP labels, particularly those with graphic warnings, have the potential to reduce intended SSB purchases. Labels that also identify healthier alternatives may influence consumers to substitute SSBs with healthier drinks. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.appet.2018.05.149,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Online randomised controlled trial,994,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Design Cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomised trial with continuous recruitment, short (fixed) exposure and blinded outcome assessors. Nurses were stratified by hours worked and randomised into training groups using a computer generated sequence. Setting An Australian national pregnancy and parenting telephone helpline. Intervention Complex intervention involving a single 2-hour group Teach-Back training session, combined with ongoing nurse self-reflection on their communication following each call and each shift. Participants Participants were 637 callers to the telephone helpline aged 18-75 (87% female), of whom 127 (13%) had inadequate health literacy (measured with the Single Item Literacy Screener); and 15 maternal and child health nurses with 15 years' experience on average. Measures Primary outcome was a modified subscale of the Health Literacy Questionnaire, 'having sufficient information to manage health'. Secondary caller outcomes included caller confidence, perceived actionability of information and nurse effort to listen and understand. Nurse outcomes were perceptions of their communication effectiveness. Results Over a 7 week period, 376 surveyed callers received usual care and 261 Teach-Back. Ratings on the primary outcome increased over time (OR 1.17, CI 1.01 to 1.32, p = 0.03) but no independent Teach-Back effect was observed. A consistent pattern suggests that, compared with usual care, Teach-Back helps callers with inadequate health literacy feel listened to (OR 2.3, CI 0.98 to 5.42, p = 0.06), confident to act (OR 2.44, CI 1.00 to 5.98, p = 0.06), and know what steps to take (OR 2.68, CI 1.00 to 7.17, p = 0.06). Nurse perceptions of both their own communication effectiveness (OR = 2.31; CI 1.38 to 3.86, p<0.0001), and caller understanding (OR = 2.56; CI 1.52 to 4.30, p<0.001) both increased with Teach-Back. No harms were reported. Conclusions Teach-Back appears to benefit telephone health service users with inadequate health literacy, but the extent of this is unclear due to smaller numbers of lower literacy participants. Improving caller ratings over time are likely due to increasing nurse communication competence. ¬© 2018 Morony et al.

There is compelling evidence to show that specific exercise programs can reduce the risk and rate of falls in community-dwelling older people. Another major health issue for older people living in the community is upper limb dysfunction, including shoulder pain. Home-based exercise programs appeal to some older people, due to their convenience. Research questions: This trial aims to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a home-based lower limb exercise program compared with a home-based upper limb exercise program to prevent falls and upper limb dysfunction among community-dwelling people aged 65+ years. Design: Randomised, controlled trial. Participants and setting: A total of 576 community-dwelling people will be recruited from the Illawarra and Shoalhaven regions of New South Wales, Australia. Intervention: Participants will be randomised to either a home-based lower limb exercise intervention or a home-based upper limb exercise intervention. The lower limb program is designed to improve balance and strength in the lower limbs. The upper limb program is designed to improve upper limb strength and mobility. Participants will attend three group-based instruction sessions to learn and progress the exercises, and will be instructed to perform the exercises three times per week at home for 12 months. Outcome measures: The two primary outcomes will be fall rates, recorded with monthly calendars for a 12-month period, and upper limb dysfunction, measured with the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will include: lower limb strength and balance; shoulder strength and mobility; physical activity; quality of life; attitudes to exercise; proportion of fallers; fear of falling; and health and community service use. The cost-effectiveness of both exercise programs from a health and community service provider perspective will be evaluated. Analysis: Negative binomial regression models will be used to estimate the between-group difference in fall rates. Modified Poisson regression models will be used to compare groups on dichotomous outcome measures. Linear regression models will be used to assess the effect of group allocation on the continuously scored measures, after adjusting for baseline scores. Two economic evaluations will be conducted: the first will assess cost-effectiveness of the lower limb program compared with the upper limb program; and the second will assess cost-effectiveness of the upper limb program compared with the lower limb program. Discussion: If effective, the trial will provide a model for both upper limb and lower limb exercise programs that can be performed at home and implemented at scale to community-dwelling older adults. ¬© 2017 Australian Physiotherapy Association",10.1016/j.jphys.2017.10.001,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a protocol / pre-analysis plan.,Field experiment,"Randomised, controlled trial (RCT)",576,"The description provided is a study protocol, which outlines the design and methodology of a trial that is planned or ongoing.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness training intervention in reducing stress and burnout among medical practitioners, by means of a Randomised Controlled Trial design. Methods: Participants were 44 intern doctors completing an emergency department rotation in a major Australian hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to either an active control (one hour extra break per week) or the 10-week mindfulness training intervention. Measures of stress and burnout were taken pre-, mid- and post intervention. Results: Participants undergoing the 10-week mindfulness training program reported greater improvements in stress and burnout relative to participants in the control condition. Significant reduction in stress and burnout was observed for participants in the mindfulness condition. No such reductions were observed for participants in the control condition. Conclusions: Mindfulness interventions may provide medical practitioners with skills to effectively manage stress and burnout, thereby reducing their experience of these symptoms. It is likely that doctors would benefit from the inclusion of such a training program as a part of their general medical education. ¬© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/0142159X.2017.1294749,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT),44,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Grade 6 students aged 10-11 years of age (N = 2288) from 63 government primary schools in Perth, Western Australia, participated in the pre, post, and follow-up study. Schools were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Aussie Optimism with teacher training, Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching, or a usual care condition that received the regular Western Australian Health Education Curriculum. Students in the Aussie Optimism conditions received 20, 1-h lessons relating to social and interpersonal skills and optimistic thinking skills over the last 2 years of primary school. Parents in the active conditions received a parent information booklet each year, plus a self-directed program in Grade 7. Students and parents completed the Extended Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Students who scored in the clinical range on the Emotional Symptoms Scale were given The Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents IV, to assess suicidal ideation and behavior, and depressive and anxiety disorders. Results indicated that Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching was associated with the best outcomes: A significant increase in student-reported pro-social behavior from pre-test to post-test 1 (maintained at post-test 2) and significantly lower incidence rates from suicidal ideation at post-test 2 and follow-up. No significant intervention effects on anxiety and depressive disorders, and total difficulties were reported. These findings suggest that the AOP with teacher training along with coaching may have the potential to positively impact on suicidality and pro-social behavior in the pre-adolescent years. ¬© 2018 Roberts, Kane, Rooney, Pintabona, Baughman, Hassan, Cross, Zubrick and Silburn.",10.3389/FPSYG.2017.01392,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,2288,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

In Australia, students are primarily vaccinated en masse, on school grounds, after parental/ guardian consent is obtained. Students most often receive little, or no, education at school about HPV or HPV vaccination prior to immunisation. There is also some uncertainty about where young people can and should obtain reliable information about the vaccine, outside of school. We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention in schools. This study aimed to improve: (1) student knowledge about HPV vaccination; (2) psycho-social outcomes and (3) vaccination uptake. In this paper, we briefly outline our educational intervention and discuss its implementation by educators including facilitators and barriers. We also discuss the study findings pertaining to student knowledge about HPV and HPV vaccination and their attitudes to vaccination across control and intervention schools. Study results showed students in intervention schools demonstrate greater knowledge and understanding of HPV and HPV vaccination. Greater knowledge and understanding of HPV and HPV vaccination appeared to promote positive attitudes towards vaccination and supported confidence with vaccination. ¬© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/14681811.2017.1300770,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,The sample size is not given.,The description does not provide specific information about whether the study showed statistically significant results.

McLeod L.J.; Hine D.W.; Bengsen A.J.; Driver A.B.,Assessing the impact of different persuasive messages on the intentions and behaviour of cat owners: A randomised control trial,2017,"Owners of free-ranging domestic cats (Felis catus) are under increasing pressure to keep their pet contained within their house or yard, in an effort to reduce adverse impacts on cat welfare, ecosystem biodiversity and neighbourhoods. We conducted a randomised online experiment to assess the effectiveness of two persuasive messages to encourage cat owners to contain their pets. A total of 512 Australian cat owners, who currently do not contain their cats, were randomly assigned to view one of three short video messages: one framed to highlight the negative impact of cats‚Äô on wildlife and biodiversity (‚Äòwildlife protection‚Äô frame), one framed to highlight the health and safety benefits of keeping cats contained (‚Äòcat benefit‚Äô frame), and a control message focused on general information about cats (‚Äòneutral‚Äô frame). We assessed the impact of these video messages on two post-treatment outcome variables: (1) the intention of owners to contain their cat; and (2) the adoption of containment practices, based on a 4-week follow-up survey. Mediation analysis revealed both the ‚Äòwildlife protection‚Äô and ‚Äòcat benefit‚Äô messages increased owners‚Äô motivation to contain their cat and their beliefs that they could effectively contain their cat to achieve the desired outcomes (response efficacy). In turn, higher levels of motivation and response efficacy predicted increased cat containment intentions and increased adoption of cat containment. In addition, the response efficacy effects of the ‚Äòcat benefit‚Äô message were strengthened by the cat owner's bond to their pet, suggesting audience segmentation may improve the effectiveness of interventions.

The present study experimentally investigated the impact of athletic and muscular fitness-idealised images compared to traditional thin ideal images on women's body dissatisfaction and exercise behaviour, under the framework of Social Comparison Theory. Participants were 106 female undergraduate students randomly assigned to view one of three sets of images (thin ideal, athletic ideal, or muscular ideal) followed by a bout of exercise. Acute exposure to athletic ideal and thin ideal images led to increased body dissatisfaction, but exposure to muscular ideal images did not. Relative to thin ideal images, fitness-idealised images did not motivate participants to engage in higher levels of exercise suggesting that this type of fitness inspiration might not motivate actual exercise behaviour. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.bodyim.2017.06.001,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,106,"The study showed that acute exposure to athletic ideal and thin ideal images led to increased body dissatisfaction, but exposure to muscular ideal images did not.

Computer assisted learning (CAL) is the implementation of computer technology in education. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a remote-online CBL (RO-CBL) with traditional face-to-face CBL on learning the outcomes of undergraduate physiotherapy students. Methods: Participants were randomized to either the control (face-to-face CBL) or to the CAL intervention (RO-CBL). The entire 3rd year physiotherapy cohort (n = 41) at Monash University, Victoria, Australia, were invited to participate in the randomized controlled trial. Outcomes included a postintervention multiple-choice test evaluating the knowledge gained from the CBL, a self-assessment of learning based on examinable learning objectives and student satisfaction with the CBL. In addition, a focus group was conducted investigating perceptions and responses to the online format. Results: Thirty-eight students (control n = 19, intervention n = 19) participated in two CBL sessions and completed the outcome assessments. CBL median scores for the postintervention multiple-choice test were comparable (Wilcoxon rank sum P = 0.61) (median/10 [range] intervention group: 9 [8‚Äì10] control group: 10 [7‚Äì10]). Of the 15 examinable learning objectives, eight were significantly in favor of the control group, suggesting a greater perceived depth of learning.

The program also involves the recruitment and training of students to act as ‚Äúcyber leaders‚Äù for their school community. In a randomized controlled trial, over 3000 Grade 8 students received the intervention and were tracked for 2 years. The intervention reduced the likelihood of new cases of cybervictimization and cyberperpetration by Grade 9, but these declines did not persist in the following year. School staff struggled to find time to fit the intervention into their usual teaching program, which may have attenuated the intervention‚Äôs effectiveness.

Cross D.; Shaw T.; Hadwen K.; Cardoso P.; Slee P.; Roberts C.; Thomas L.; Barnes A.,Longitudinal impact of the Cyber Friendly Schools program on adolescents' cyberbullying behavior,2016,"Cyberbullying is a major public health problem associated with serious mental, social, and academic consequences for young people. To date, few programs addressing cyberbullying have been developed and empirically tested. The Cyber Friendly Schools (CFS) group-randomized controlled trial measured the longitudinal impact of a whole-school online cyberbullying prevention and intervention program, developed in partnership with young people. Non-government secondary schools in Perth, Western Australia, (N=35; 3,000+ students) were randomized to an intervention (n=19) or usual practice control group (n=16 schools). Students completed online questionnaires in 2010, 2011, and at 1-year follow-up in 2012, measuring their cyberbullying experiences during the previous school term. The intervention group received the program in Grades 8 and 9 (aged 13-14 years). Program effects were tested using two-part growth models. The program was associated with significantly greater declines in the odds of involvement in cyber-victimization and perpetration from pre- to the first post-test, but no other differences were evident between the study conditions. However, teachers implemented only one third of the program content. More work is needed to build teacher capacity and self-efficacy to effectively implement cyberbullying programs. Whole-school cyberbullying interventions implemented in conjunction with other bullying prevention programs may reduce cyber-victimization more than traditional school-based bullying prevention programs alone.

However, robust evidence of the cost-effectiveness of pricing manipulations on dietary behaviour is limited. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a 20% price reduction on fruits and vegetables and a combined skills-based behaviour change and price reduction intervention. Design and methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective was undertaken for the randomized controlled trial Supermarket Healthy Eating for Life (SHELf). Female shoppers in Melbourne, Australia were randomized to: (1) skill-building (n = 160); (2) price reductions (n = 161); (3) combined skill-building and price reduction (n = 161); or (4) control group (n = 161). The intervention was implemented for three months followed by a six month follow-up. Costs were measured in 2012 Australian dollars. Fruit and vegetable purchasing and consumption were measured in grams/week. Results: At three months, compared to control participants, price reduction participants increased vegetable purchases by 233 g/week (95% CI 4 to 462, p = 0.046) and fruit purchases by 364 g/week (95% CI 95 to 633, p = 0.008). Participants in the combined group purchased 280 g/week more fruits (95% CI 27 to 533, p = 0.03) than participants in the control group. Increases were not maintained six-month post intervention. No effect was noticed in the skill-building group. Compared to the control group, the price reduction intervention cost an additional A$2.3 per increased serving of vegetables purchased per week or an additional A$3 per increased serving of fruit purchased per week. The combined intervention cost an additional A$12 per increased serving of fruit purchased per week compared to the control group. Conclusions: A 20% discount on fruits and vegetables was effective in promoting overall fruit and vegetable purchases during the period the discount was active and may be cost-effective.

Participants were 130 female undergraduate students who were randomly assigned to view either a set of Instagram fitspiration images or a control set of travel images presented on an iPad. Results showed that acute exposure to fitspiration images led to increased negative mood and body dissatisfaction and decreased state appearance self-esteem relative to travel images.

Significantly lower scores on measures of anxiety (Cohen's d=. 1.43; 95% CI: 0.89 - 1.93) and depression (Cohen's d=. 1.79; 95% CI: 1.21 - 2.32) were found among the treatment group compared to the control group at posttreatment. These lower scores were maintained at 3-month and 12-month follow-up and the treatment group rated the iCBT treatment as acceptable. The treatment group had slightly higher costs ($92.2; 95% CI: $38.7 to $149.2) and Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs. =. 0.010; 95% CI: 0.003 to 0.018) than the control group at posttreatment and the intervention was found to have a greater than 95% probability of being cost-effective. The results support iCBT as an efficacious and cost-effective treatment option for older adults with symptoms of anxiety. ¬© 2014 Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies.",10.1016/j.beth.2014.09.007,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,72,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Design Pragmatic cluster randomised trial where volunteer general practices were stratified by postcode advantage or disadvantage score and billing type (private, free national health, community health centre), then randomised into either intervention or comparison arms using a computer generated random sequence. Three months post-intervention, patients were recruited from all practices post-consultation for a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview and followed up three and 12 months later. Researchers recruiting, consenting and interviewing patients and patients themselves were masked to allocation status; clinicians were not. Setting General practices in metropolitan and rural Victoria, Australia Participants General practices with at least one interested clinician (general practitioner or nurse) and their 14-24 year old patients. Intervention This complex intervention was designed using evidence based practice in learning and change in clinician behaviour and general practice systems, and included best practice approaches to motivating change in adolescent risk taking behaviours. The intervention involved training clinicians (nine hours) in health risk screening, use of a screening tool and motivational interviewing; training all practice staff (receptionists and clinicians) in engaging youth; provision of feedback to clinicians of patients' risk data; and two practice visits to support new screening and referral resources. Comparison clinicians received one didactic educational seminar (three hours) on engaging youth and health risk screening. Outcome Measures Primary outcomes were patient report of (1) clinician detection of at least one of six health risk behaviours (tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug use, risks for sexually transmitted infection, STI, unplanned pregnancy, and road risks); and (2) change in one or more of the six health risk behaviours, at three months or at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were likelihood of future visits, trust in the clinician after exit interview, clinician detection of emotional distress and fear and abuse in relationships, and emotional distress at three and 12 months. Patient acceptability of the screening tool was also described for the intervention arm. Analyses were adjusted for practice location and billing type, patients' sex, age, and recruitment method, and past health risks, where appropriate. An intention to treat analysis approach was used, which included multilevel multiple imputation for missing outcome data. Results 42 practices were randomly allocated to intervention or comparison arms. Two intervention practices withdrew post allocation, prior to training, leaving 19 intervention (53 clinicians, 377 patients) and 21 comparison (79 clinicians, 524 patients) practices. 69% of patients in both intervention (260) and comparison (360) arms completed the 12 month follow-up. Intervention clinicians discussed more health risks per patient (59.7%) than comparison clinicians (52.7%) and thus were more likely to detect a higher proportion of young people with at least one of the six health risk behaviours (38.4% vs 26.7%, risk difference [RD] 11.6%, Confidence Interval [CI] 2.93% to 20.3%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.7, CI 1.1 to 2.5). Patients reported less illicit drug use (RD -6.0, CI -11 to -1.2; OR 0¬∑52, CI 0¬∑28 to 0¬∑96), and less risk for STI (RD -5.4, CI -11 to 0.2; OR 0¬∑66, CI 0¬∑46 to 0¬∑96) at three months in the intervention relative to the comparison arm, and for unplanned pregnancy at 12 months (RD-4.4; CI -8.7 to -0.1; OR 0¬∑40, CI 0¬∑20 to 0¬∑80). No differences were detected between arms on other health risks. There were no differences on secondary outcomes, apart from a greater detection of abuse (OR 13.8, CI 1.71 to 111). There were no reports of harmful events and intervention arm youth had high acceptance of the screening tool. Conclusions A complex intervention, compared to a simple educational seminar for practices, improved detection of health risk behaviours in young people. Impact on health outcomes was inconclusive. Technology enabling more efficient, systematic health-risk screening may allow providers to target counselling toward higher risk individuals. Further trials require more power to confirm health benefits. ¬© 2015 Sanci et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0137581,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,901,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

A pretest, posttest parallel group, single blind multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted with 308 students between the ages of 4 and 8 years old (M age = 5.8 years, SD = 0.8 years). Findings suggested that computer-based instruction under controlled conditions can improve student literacy, especially for Indigenous students at risk of reading difficulties. The authors examine the fidelity with which the computer-based literacy tool was implemented and the impact of implementation fidelity measures on student outcomes. Student exposure to and use of the literacy tool, and quality of instruction and lesson delivery, were analyzed for their influence on students literacy outcomes. Implementation fidelity measures accounted for between 1.8% and 15% of the variance of intervention students scores. ¬© 2014 Copyright ¬© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/00220671.2013.823369,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A regular RCT,308,"The description does not provide specific information on whether the results were statistically significant.

Waghorn G.; Dias S.; Gladman B.; Harris M.; Saha S.,A multi-site randomised controlled trial of evidence-based supported employment for adults with severe and persistent mental illness,2014,"Background/aim: The Individual Placement and Support (IPS) approach is an evidence-based form of supported employment for people with severe and persistent mental illness. This approach is not yet widely available in Australia even though there is mounting evidence of its generalisability outside the USA. One previous Australian randomised controlled trial found that IPS is effective for young people with first episode psychosis. The aim of the current trial was to assess the effectiveness of evidence-based supported employment when implemented for Australian adult consumers of public mental health services by utilising existing service systems. Methods: A four-site randomised control trial design (n = 208) was conducted in Brisbane (two sites), Townsville and Cairns. The intervention consisted of an IPS supported employment service hosted by a community mental health team. The control condition was delivered at each site by mental health teams referring consumers to other disability employment services in the local area. Results: At 12 months, those in the IPS condition had 2.4 times greater odds of commencing employment than those in the control condition (42.5% vs. 23.5%). The conditions did not differ on secondary employment outcomes including job duration, hours worked, or job diversity. Attrition was higher than expected in both conditions with 28.4% completing the baseline interview but taking no further part in the study. Conclusion: The results support previous international findings that IPS-supported employment is more effective than non-integrated supported employment. IPS can be successfully implemented this way in Australia, but with a loss of effect strength compared to previous USA trials. ¬© 2014 Occupational Therapy Australia.",10.1111/1440-1630.12148,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,208,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Assessments were completed at baseline, before beginning the intervention, immediately following the intervention, and at 3-, 6-, and 12- months follow-up. The primary outcomes were physical activity and sedentary time assessed by accelerometers and servings of fruit, vegetables and junk food assessed by 3-day food records.; Background: To determine the effects of participation in Curtin University's Activity, Food and Attitudes Program (CAFAP), a community-based, family-centered behavioural intervention, on the physical activity, sedentary time, and healthy eating behaviours of overweight and obese adolescents.; Results: During the intensive 8-week intervention sedentary time decreased by 25.1 min/day/month (95% CI: -11.0, 0.8) which was significantly greater than the rate of change during the waitlist period (p = .014). Moderate physical activity increased by 1.8 min/day/month (95% CI: -0.04, 3.6) during the intervention period, which was significantly greater than the rate of change during the waitlist period (p = .041).

Antrobus E.; Elffers H.; White G.; Mazerolle L.,Nonresponse bias in randomized controlled experiments in criminology: Putting the Queensland Community Engagement Trial (QCET) under a microscope,2013,"Method: We use two methods (Cochrane and Elffers methods) to explore nonresponse bias: First, we assess the impact of the low response rate by examining the effects of nonresponse group differences between the experimental and control conditions and pooled variance under different scenarios. Second, we assess the degree to which item response rates are influenced by the control and experimental conditions.; Results: Our analysis of the QCET data suggests that our substantive findings are not influenced by the low response rate in the trial. The results are robust even under extreme conditions, and statistical significance of the results would only be compromised in cases where the pooled variance was much larger for the nonresponse group and the difference between experimental and control conditions was greatly diminished. We also find that there were no biases in the item response rates across the experimental and control conditions.; Conclusion: RCTs that involve field survey responses‚Äîlike QCET‚Äîare potentially compromised by low response rates and how item response rates might be influenced by the control or experimental conditions. Our results show that the QCET results were not sensitive to the overall low response rate across the experimental and control conditions and the item response rates were not significantly different across the experimental and control groups. Overall, our analysis suggests that the results of QCET are robust and any biases in the survey responses do not significantly influence the main experimental findings.; Objectives: The goal of this article is to examine whether or not the results of the Queensland Community Engagement Trial (QCET)‚Äîa randomized controlled trial that tested the impact of procedural justice policing on citizen attitudes toward police‚Äîwere affected by different types of nonresponse bias. ¬© The Author(s) 2014.",10.1177/0193841X13518534,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The study showed that the results of the Queensland Community Engagement Trial (QCET) were robust and not significantly influenced by the low response rate or nonresponse,Justice

Exercise interventions can reduce fall risk, but adherence is often low. A new exergame involving step training may provide an enjoyable exercise alternative for preventing falls in older people. Purpose: To assess the feasibility and safety of unsupervised, home-based step pad training and determine the effectiveness of this intervention on stepping performance and associated fall risk in older people. Design: Single-blinded two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing step pad training with control (no-intervention). Setting/Participants: Thirty-seven older adults residing in independent-living units of a retirement village in Sydney, Australia. Intervention: Intervention group (IG) participants were provided with a computerized step pad system connected to their TVs and played a step game as often as they liked (with a recommended dose of 2-3 sessions per week for 15-20 minutes each) for eight weeks. In addition, IG participants were asked to complete a choice stepping reaction time (CSRT) task once each week. Main Outcome Measures: CSRT, the Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA), neuropsychological and functional mobility measures were assessed at baseline and eight week follow-up. Results: Thirty-two participants completed the study (86.5%). IG participants played a median 2.75 sessions/week and no adverse events were reported. Compared to the control group, the IG significantly improved their CSRT (F31,1 = 18.203, p<.001), PPA composite scores (F31,1 = 12.706, p = 0.001), as well as the postural sway (F31,1 = 4.226, p = 0.049) and contrast sensitivity (F31,1 = 4.415, p = 0.044) PPA sub-component scores. In addition, the IG improved significantly in their dual-task ability as assessed by a timed up and go test/verbal fluency task (F31,1 = 4.226, p = 0.049). Conclusions: Step pad training can be safely undertaken at home to improve physical and cognitive parameters of fall risk in older people without major cognitive and physical impairments.

Parry S.; Straker L.; Gilson N.D.; Smith A.J.,Participatory workplace interventions can reduce sedentary time for office workers - A randomised controlled trial,2013,"Background: Occupational sedentary behaviour is an important contributor to overall sedentary risk. There is limited evidence for effective workplace interventions to reduce occupational sedentary time and increase light activity during work hours. The purpose of the study was to determine if participatory workplace interventions could reduce total sedentary time, sustained sedentary time (bouts >30 minutes), increase the frequency of breaks in sedentary time and promote light intensity activity and moderate/vigorous activity (MVPA) during work hours. Methods: A randomised controlled trial (ANZCTR number: ACTN12612000743864) was conducted using clerical, call centre and data processing workers (n = 62, aged 25-59 years) in 3 large government organisations in Perth, Australia. Three groups developed interventions with a participatory approach: 'Active office' (n = 19), 'Active Workstation' and promotion of incidental office activity; 'Traditional physical activity' (n = 14), pedometer challenge to increase activity between productive work time and 'Office ergonomics' (n = 29), computer workstation design and breaking up computer tasks. Accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X, 7 days) determined sedentary time, sustained sedentary time, breaks in sedentary time, light intensity activity and MVPA on work days and during work hours were measured before and following a 12 week intervention period. Results: For all participants there was a significant reduction in sedentary time on work days (-1.6%, p = 0.006) and during work hours (-1.7%, p = 0.014) and a significant increase in number of breaks/sedentary hour on work days (0.64, p = 0.005) and during work hours (0.72, p = 0.015); there was a concurrent significant increase in light activity during work hours (1.5%, p = 0.012) and MVPA on work days (0.6%, p = 0.012). Conclusions: This study explored novel ways to modify work practices to reduce occupational sedentary behaviour. Participatory workplace interventions can reduce sedentary time, increase the frequency of breaks and improve light activity and MVPA of office workers by using a variety of interventions.

Background: Studies have shown sustained nurse home visiting commencing pre-natally to be effective. Few studies have explored the processes by which pre-natal activities by nurses contribute to achieving effective outcomes. Design: Process evaluation. Methods: Process and outcome data from a randomized controlled trial of sustained nurse home visiting in an area of socioeconomic disadvantage in Western Sydney between 2005-2008 were collated. The pre-natal intervention focused on improving transition to parenting by supporting mothers through pregnancy. Health and service use outcome data were analysed for 208 women (111 intervention; 97 comparison receiving usual care). Five nurses delivering the intervention completed checklists detailing activities undertaken. Results: Nurses provided information, psychosocial support, and health promoting activities for families. Intervention mothers had a higher rate of unassisted vaginal births than the general population. Compared with comparison mothers, intervention mothers at 4-6¬†weeks postnatally reported better general health and felt significantly more enabled to cope with and understand their baby and to care for themselves and their baby. Conclusion: Comprehensive support, in a context of enabling client-nurse relationships and continuity of carer are the ways by which antenatal nurse home visiting achieves benefits for women and infants, having an impact on both clinical outcomes such as rates of normal vaginal delivery and maternal service engagement. ¬© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/jan.12052,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Something else,Process evaluation,208,"The study reported that intervention mothers had a higher rate of unassisted vaginal births than the general population and, compared with comparison mothers, reported better general",Parenting; Health; Mental health

Two-hundred and twenty four households from a small regional center in Australia were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: (1) Education only - households received a wood smoke reduction education pack containing information about the negative health impacts of wood smoke pollution, and advice about wood heater operation and firewood management; (2) SmartBurn only - households received a SmartBurn canister designed to improve combustion and help wood fires burn more efficiently, (3) Education and SmartBurn, and (4) neither Education nor SmartBurn (control). Analysis of covariance, controlling for pre-intervention household wood smoke emissions, wood moisture content, and wood heater age, revealed that education and SmartBurn were both associated with significant reduction in wood smoke emissions during the post-intervention period. Follow-up mediation analyses indicated that education reduced emissions by improving wood heater operation practices, but not by increasing health risk perceptions. As predicted, SmartBurn exerted a direct effect on emission levels, unmediated by wood heater operation practices or health risk perceptions. ¬© 2011.",10.1016/j.jenvp.2011.05.003,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,224,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Gambling behavior; including bet-size, speed of betting, final payouts and trials played on the EGM; was investigated with respect to participants' assigned arousal condition, problem-gambling status, and affective state. At-risk gamblers with few self-reported negative emotions placed higher average bets at the EGM after having held the crocodile when compared to the control. In contrast, at-risk gamblers with many self-reported negative emotions placed lower average bets at the EGM after having held the crocodile. The results suggest that high arousal can intensify gambling in at-risk players, but only if this feeling state is not perceived as a negative emotion. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",10.1007/s10899-009-9174-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,103,"The study suggests that high arousal can intensify gambling in at-risk players, but only if this feeling state is not perceived as a negative emotion.",Gambling; Mental health
Rodrigo S.; Sinclair M.; Leder K.,A survey of the characteristics and maintenance of rainwater tanks in urban areas of South Australia,2010,"Households resident in metropolitan Adelaide and surrounding areas in South Australia were recruited into a randomised controlled trial. A total of 630 rainwater tanks with a total tank capacity of 14.5ML were installed at the 325 households surveyed. The majority of the tanks were plumbed into the kitchen (64.6%), over 10 years in age (45.5%), over 15,000 L in capacity (42.5%) and composed of galvanised steel (36.9%). Over 90% of the households undertook one or more prevention and maintenance strategies for reducing contamination of collected rainwater. The use of first flush diverters was reported by 30.8% households, the presence of leaf control devices on the tank by 57.2%, and the presence of leaf control screens on gutters by 25.5% households. Most households reported that the rainwater tank was cleaned at some time, with 50.4% of these households stating that tank cleaning occurred 1 to 5 years previously, and 31.9% more than 5 years prior to enrolment Rainwater from the main drinking tank was sampled from a subset of households for turbidity and metals (Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Pb, Zn). This information regarding tank characteristics and degree of adherence to recommended maintenance procedures may assist understanding of variability in rainwater quality data and may help determine whether untreated rainwater can be considered a safe water supply for household purposes including drinking. ¬© IWA Publishing 2010.",10.2166/wst.2010.055,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Unsure,325,"The description does not provide information on whether the study showed statistically significant results.

The Lifestyle approach to reducing Falls through Exercise (LiFE) involves embedding balance and lower limb strength training in habitual daily routines. Methods: A total of 34 community-residing people aged ‚â•70 years were randomised either into the LiFE programme or into a no-intervention control group and followed up for six months. Inclusion criteria were two or more falls or an injurious fall in the past year. Results: There were 12 falls in the intervention group and 35 in the control group. Therelative risk (RR) analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in falls (RR = 0.23; 0.07-0.83). There were indications that dynamic balance (P = 0.04 at three months) and efficacy beliefs (P = 0.04 at six months) improved for the LiFE programme participants. In general, secondary physical and health status outcomes, which were hypothesised as potential mediators of fall risk, improved minimally and inconsistently. Conclusions: LiFE was effective in reducing recurrent falls in this at-risk sample. However, there were minimal changes in secondary measures. The study was feasible in terms of recruitment, randomisation, blinding and data collection. A larger randomised trial is needed to investigate long-term efficacy, mechanisms of benefit and clinical significance of this new intervention. ¬© 2010 The Authors.

White E.; Winstanley J.,"A randomised controlled trial of clinical supervision: Selected findings from a novel Australian attempt to establish the evidence base for causal relationships with quality of care and patient outcomes, as an informed contribution to mental health nursing practice development",2010,"This paper reports on selected findings from a novel randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in mental health settings in Queensland, Australia. Several national and state reports recently revealed the sub-optimal state of Australian mental health service provision which have direct implications for mental health nursing, including the privately experienced cost of working and coping in these settings. Clinical supervision (CS), a structured staff support arrangement, has shown promise as a positive contribution to the clinical practice development agenda and is now found reflected in health policy themes elsewhere in the world. However, CS is underdeveloped in Australia and the empirical evidence base for the informed implementation of CS, per se, has remained elusive. Within the overall context of a RCT design, therefore, and supplemented by other data collection methods, this large and generously funded study attempted to make an incremental contribution to better understanding this demanding substantive domain. Whilst the substantive insights and theoretical propositions reported here were derived from, and may be limited by, a sub-specialty of nursing and a single geographic location, they were earthed in the personal self-reported experience of those directly involved with a clinical practice innovation. They may resonate with counterparts beyond mental health nursing and Queensland, Australia, respectively, therefore, and may assist in both conceptualising and operationalising CS research, education, management, policy and clinical practice development decision making in the future. ¬© The Author(s), 2010.",10.1177/1744987109357816,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The description does not provide specific information about whether the study showed statistically significant results or what those results were.,Health; Mental health; Education
Boreland F.; Lesjak M.; Lyle D.,Evaluation of home lead remediation in an Australian mining community,2009,"In 1994 a comprehensive program was established to reduce children's blood lead levels in Broken Hill, NSW, Australia. Home remediation (abatement of lead hazards in a child's home) was included as part of a case management strategy for children with blood lead levels ‚â• 15 Œºg/dL. Children with blood lead levels ‚â• 30 Œºg/dL were offered immediate home remediation. Children with blood lead levels of 15-29 Œºg/dL were allocated to 'immediate' or 'delayed' home remediation; a subset of these participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of home remediation for reducing blood lead levels. One hundred and seventeen children received home remediation. One hundred and thirteen returned for follow-up blood tests, 88 of whom participated in the RCT. On average children's blood lead levels decreased by 1.7 Œºg/dL (10%) in the 6 months after remediation and by 2.2 Œºg/dL (13%) in the 6-12 months after remediation. However, remediation did not significantly change the rate of decline in blood lead levels (P = 0.609). There was no evidence of association between change in children's blood lead levels and changes in lead loading in their homes. The results are consistent with the published literature, which suggests that home remediation does not reduce children's exposure to lead sufficiently to cause a moderate or greater decrease in their blood lead level. In communities where lead is widely dispersed, the study suggests that it is important to assess potential sources and pathways by which children are exposed to lead when developing an intervention plan, and the need for multiple interventions to effectively reduce blood lead levels. The findings reinforce the ongoing need for rigorous epidemiological evaluation of lead management programs to improve the evidence base, and for effective primary prevention to avoid children being exposed to lead in the first place. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The study was a community-clustered randomised controlled trial over two years, set in 30 remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory of Australia. Children aged 18-47 months at baseline were enrolled in the study. The intervention included fluoride varnish applications, training of primary care workers, and health promotion for oral health at an individual, family and community level. Intervention communities received six-monthly visits over two years and control communities were visited at baseline and two years later with no contact in the intervening period. The outcome measures reported in this paper are the impact of the intervention on two secondary endpoints: oral health promotion activities in the community and personal oral health practices of children. Results: The intervention did not produce any significant change in oral health behaviours, clinical measures of oral hygiene, or community programmes promoting oral health.

Design: Cluster-randomised trial with intention-to-treat analysis. Participants: 115 adolescent females from four regional sporting academies aged 16 yr (SD 1) and with an average Australian bra size of 12B. Intervention: The experimental group received an education booklet on bra fit and breast support from a sports physiotherapist. The control group received no intervention. Outcome measures: The primary outcome was bra knowledge measured by a questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were a pass on the Bra Fit Assessment and the Level of Breast Support tests, and breast discomfort during exercise rated on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. Results: Four months after receiving the education booklet, the experimental group had improved their bra knowledge 19% (95% CI 14 to 25) more than the control group. In addition, 39% (95% CI 19 to 54) more of the experimental group passed the Bra Fit Assessment test and 30% (95% CI 11 to 47) more passed the Level of Breast Support test than the control group at 4 months. There was no difference in the level of breast discomfort during exercise.

Graves N.; Barnett A.G.; Halton K.A.; Veerman J.L.; Winkler E.; Owen N.; Reeves M.M.; Marshall A.; Eakin E.,Cost-effectiveness of a telephone-delivered intervention for physical activity and diet,2009,"Background: Given escalating rates of chronic disease, broad-reach and cost-effective interventions to increase physical activity and improve dietary intake are needed. The cost-effectiveness of a Telephone Counselling intervention to improve physical activity and diet, targeting adults with established chronic diseases in a low socio-economic area of a major Australian city was examined. Methodology/Principal Findings: A cost-effectiveness modelling study using data collected between February 2005 and November 2007 from a cluster-randomised trial that compared Telephone Counselling with a ""Usual Care"" (brief intervention) alternative. Economic outcomes were assessed using a state-transition Markov model, which predicted the progress of participants through five health states relating to physical activity and dietary improvement, for ten years after recruitment. The costs and health benefits of Telephone Counselling, Usual Care and an existing practice (Real Control) group were compared. Telephone Counselling compared to Usual Care was not cost-effective ($78,489 per quality adjusted life year gained). However, the Usual Care group did not represent existing practice and is not a useful comparator for decision making. Comparing Telephone Counselling outcomes to existing practice (Real Control), the intervention was found to be cost-effective ($29,375 per quality adjusted life year gained). Usual Care (brief intervention) compared to existing practice (Real Control) was also cost-effective ($12,153 per quality adjusted life year gained). Conclusions/Significance: This modelling study shows that a decision to adopt a Telephone Counselling program over existing practice (Real Control) is likely to be cost-effective. Choosing the 'Usual Care' brief intervention over existing practice (Real Control) shows a lower cost per quality adjusted life year, but the lack of supporting evidence for efficacy or sustainability is an important consideration for decision makers. The economics of behavioural approaches to improving health must be made explicit if decision makers are to be convinced that allocating resources toward such programs is worthwhile. ¬© 2009 Graves et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0007135,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Something else,A clustered RCT,The sample size is not given.,The abstract does not provide information on whether the results were statistically significant.

Monaghan S.; Blaszczynski A.,Impact of mode of display and message content of responsible gambling signs for electronic gaming machines on regular gamblers,2010,"Harm-minimization strategies aim to reduce gambling-related risks; however, minimal evidence supports the effectiveness of current strategies involving the placement of warning signs in gambling venues and on electronic gaming machines (EGMs). This qualitative replication study evaluated the differential effect of pop-up messages compared to static signs and the content of messages on EGMs on recall, thoughts, and behaviors assessed during the session and at 2-week follow-up. In Study 1, 127 regular EGM gamblers (male = 97, mean age = 20. 3) recruited from a university student population attended a laboratory where they were randomly assigned to play a computer-based simulated EGM analogue displaying signs that differed by (a) mode of presentation (pop-up and static) and (b) message content (informative, self-appraisal, and control/blank). In Study 2, an identical methodology was used but included the use of a simulated EGM within an in vivo gaming setting with 124 regular EGM players (male = 81, mean age = 44.1). Results from both studies showed that pop-up messages were recalled more effectively than static messages immediately and at 2-week follow-up. Pop-up messages reportedly had a significantly greater impact on within-session thoughts and behaviors. Messages encouraging self-appraisal resulted in significantly greater effect on self-reported thoughts and behaviors during both the experimental session and in subsequent EGM play. These findings support the effectiveness of pop-up messages containing self-appraisal messages as an appropriate harm-minimization initiative. ¬© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",10.1007/s10899-009-9150-z,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,127 in Study 1 and 124 in Study 2.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Palmer E.J.; Devitt P.G.,Limitations of student-driven formative assessment in a clinical clerkship. A randomised controlled trial,2008,"Background. Teachers strive to motivate their students to be self-directed learners. One of the methods used is to provide online formative assessment material. The concept of formative assessment and use of these processes is heavily promoted, despite limited evidence as to their efficacy. Methods. Fourth year medical students, in their first year of clinical work were divided into four groups. In addition to the usual clinical material, three of the groups were provided with some form of supplementary learning material. For two groups, this was provided as online formative assessment. The amount of time students spent on the supplementary material was measured, their opinion on learning methods was surveyed, and their performance in summative exams at the end of their surgical attachments was measured. Results. The performance of students was independent of any educational intervention imposed by this study. Despite its ready availability and promotion, student use of the online formative tools was poor. Conclusion. Formative learning is an ideal not necessarily embraced by students. If formative assessment is to work students need to be encouraged to participate, probably by implementing some form of summative assessment. ¬© 2008 Palmer and Devitt; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1472-6920-8-29,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The study did not show statistically significant results.

Duggan P.M.; Palmer E.; Devitt P.,Electronic voting to encourage interactive lectures: A randomised trial,2007,"Background. Electronic Voting Systems have been used for education in a variety of disciplines. Outcomes from these studies have been mixed. Because results from these studies have been mixed, we examined whether an EVS system could enhance a lecture's effect on educational outcomes. Methods. A cohort of 127 Year 5 medical students at the University of Adelaide was stratified by gender, residency status and academic record then randomised into 2 groups of 64 and 63 students. Each group received consecutive 40-minute lectures on two clinical topics. One group received the EVS for both topics. The other group received traditional teaching only. Evaluation was undertaken with two, 15-question multiple-choice questionnaires (MCQ) assessing knowledge and problem solving and undertaken as a written paper immediately before and after the lectures and repeated online 8-12 weeks later. Standardised institutional student questionnaires were completed for each lecture and independent observers assessed student behaviour during the lectures. Lecturer's opinions were assessed by a questionnaire developed for this study. Results. Two-thirds of students randomised to EVS and 59% of students randomised to traditional lectures attended. One-half of the students in the EVS group and 41% in the traditional group completed all questionnaires. There was no difference in MCQ scores between EVS and traditional lectures (p = 0.785). The cervical cancer lectures showed higher student ranking in favour of EVS in all parameters. The breast cancer lectures showed higher ranking in favour of traditional lectures in 5 of 7 parameters (p < 0.001). The observed higher-order lecturer-students interactions were increased in the EVS lecture for one lecturer and reduced for the other. Both lecturers felt that the EVS lectures were difficult to prepare, that they were able to keep to time in the traditional lectures, that the educational value of both lecture styles was similar, and that they were neutral-to-slightly favourably disposed to continue with the EVS technology. The 2 lecturers disagreed regarding the ease of preparation of the traditional lecture, their ability to keep to time in the EVS lecture, and personal satisfaction with the EVS lecture. The lecturers felt that EVS encouraged student participation and helped identify where students were having difficulty. Conclusion. In this setting, EVS technology used in large group lectures did not offer significant advantages over the more traditional lecture format. ¬© 2007 Duggan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1472-6920-7-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,127,The study did not show statistically significant results in terms of MCQ scores between EVS and traditional lectures (p = 0.785).

Boreland F.; Lyle D.M.,Lead dust in Broken Hill homes: Effect of remediation on indoor lead levels,2006,"This study was undertaken to determine whether home remediation effectively reduced indoor lead levels in Broken Hill, a long-established silver-lead-zinc mining town in outback Australia. A before-after study of the effect of home remediation on indoor lead levels was embedded into a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of remediation for reducing elevated blood lead levels in young children. Moist towelettes were used to measure lead loading (Œºg/m2) on internal windowsills and internal and entry floors of 98 homes; samples were collected before, immediately after, and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months after remediation. Data were log10 transformed for the analysis. Remediation reduced average indoor lead levels by approximately 50%, and lead levels remained low for the duration of the follow-up period (10 months). The greatest gains were made in homes with the highest initial lead levels; homes with low preremediation lead levels showed little or no benefit. Before remediation, homes located in areas with high soil lead levels or with ""poor"" dust proofing had higher lead levels than those in areas with lower soil lead levels or with ""medium"" or ""good"" dust proofing; these relative differences remained after remediation. There was no evidence that lead loading was reduced by an increased opportunity to become aware of lead issues. We conclude that remediation is an effective strategy for reducing the lead exposure of children living in homes with high indoor lead levels. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Dyke P.; Jamrozik K.; Plant A.J.,A randomized trial of a problem-based learning approach for teaching epidemiology,2001,"Purpose. To conduct a controlled trial of traditional and problem-based learning (PBL) methods of teaching epidemiology. Method. All second-year medical students (n = 136) at The University of Western Australia Medical School were offered the chance to participate in a randomized controlled trial of teaching methods for an epidemiology course. Students who consented to participate (n = 80) were randomly assigned to either a PBL or a traditional course. Students who did not consent or did not return the consent form (n = 56) were assigned to the traditional course. Students in both streams took identical quizzes and exams. These scores, a collection of semi-quantitative feedback from all students, and a qualitative analysis of interviews with a convenience sample of six students from each stream were compared. Results. There was no significant difference in performances on quizzes or exams between PBL and traditional students. Students using PBL reported a stronger grasp of epidemiologic principles, enjoyed working with a group, and, at the end of the course, were more enthusiastic about epidemiology and its professional relevance to them than were students in the traditional course. PBL students worked more steadily during the semester but spent only marginally more time on the epidemiology course overall. Interviews corroborated these findings. Non-consenting students were older (p < 0.02) and more likely to come from non-English-speaking backgrounds (p < 0.005). Conclusions.

Milligan-Saville et al.,Workplace mental health training for managers and its effect on sick leave in employees: a cluster randomised controlled trial,2017,"Background
Mental illness is one of the most rapidly increasing causes of long-term sickness absence, despite improved rates of detection and development of more effective interventions. However, mental health training for managers might help improve occupational outcomes for people with mental health problems. We aimed to investigate the effect of mental health training on managers' knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and behaviour towards employees with mental health problems, and its effect on employee sickness absence.
Methods
We did a cluster randomised controlled trial of manager mental health training within a large Australian fire and rescue service, with a 6-month follow-up. Managers (clusters) at the level of duty commander or equivalent were randomly assigned (1:1) using an online random sequence generator to either a 4-h face-to-face RESPECT mental health training programme or a deferred training control group. Researchers, managers, and employees were not masked to the outcome of randomisation. Firefighters and station officers supervised by each manager were included in the study via their anonymised sickness absence records. The primary outcome measure was change in sickness absence among those supervised by each of the managers. We analysed rates of work-related sick leave and standard sick leave seperately, with rate being defined as sickness absence hours divided by the sum of hours of sickness absence and hours of attendance. This trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12613001156774).
Findings
128 managers were recruited between Feb 18, 2014, and May 17, 2014. 46 (71%) of 65 managers allocated to the intervention group received the intervention, and 42 (67%) of 63 managers allocated to the control group were entered in the deferred training group. Managers and their employees were followed up and reassessed at 6 months after randomisation. 25 managers (1233 employees) in the intervention group and 19 managers (733 employees) in the control group provided data for the primary analysis. During the 6-month follow-up, the mean rate of work-related sick leave decreased by 0¬∑28 percentage points (pp) from a pre-training mean of 1¬∑56% (SE 0¬∑23) in the intervention group and increased by 0¬∑28 pp from 0¬∑95% (0¬∑20) in the control group (p=0¬∑049), corresponding to a reduction of 6¬∑45 h per employee per 6 months. The mean percentage of standard sick leave increased by 0¬∑48 pp from 4¬∑97% (0¬∑22) in the intervention group and by 0¬∑31 pp from 5¬∑27% (0¬∑21) in the control group (p=0¬∑169).
Interpretation
A 4-h manager mental health training programme could lead to a significant reduction in work-related sickness absence, with an associated return on investment of ¬£9.98 for each pound spent on such training.

Method: A prospective, two-armed randomized controlled trial of 110 overweight/obese (BMI 25-40) (mean [SD] age = 44.4 [8.6] years; BMI = 30.5 [3.6]) male employees at Tomago Aluminium aged 18-65. In October (2009) men were randomized to either (i) WP program (n=65) or (ii) a 14-week wait-list control group (n=45). The 3-month program involved one information session, program booklets, group-based financial incentives and an online component. Men were assessed at baseline and at 14-week follow-up for weight (primary outcome), waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, resting heart rate, self-reported physical activity and dietary variables, and physical activity and dietary cognitions.

Results: Intention-to-treat analysis using linear mixed models revealed significant between group differences for weight loss after 14 weeks (P < .001, Cohen's d = 0.34). Significant intervention effects were also found for waist circumference (P < .001, d = 0.63), BMI (P < .001, d = 0.41), systolic blood pressure (P = .02, d = 0.48), resting heart rate (P < .001, d = 0.81), physical activity (P = .03, d = 0.77), sweetened beverages (P < .02, d = 0.5-0.6) and physical activity-related cognitions (P < .02, d=0.6).

"Mudiyanselage SB, Price AM, Mensah FK, Bryson HE, Perlen S, Orsini F, Hiscock H, Dakin P, Harris D, Noble K and Bruce T ",Economic evaluation of an Australian nurse home visiting programme: a randomised trial at 3 years,2021,"Objectives: To investigate the additional programme cost and cost-effectiveness of 'right@home' Nurse Home Visiting (NHV) programme in relation to improving maternal and child outcomes at child age 3 years compared with usual care.

Design: A cost-utility analysis from a government-as-payer perspective alongside a randomised trial of NHV over 3-year period. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted at 5%. Analysis used an intention-to-treat approach with multiple imputation.

Setting: The right@home was implemented from 2013 in Victoria and Tasmania states of Australia, as a primary care service for pregnant women, delivered until child age 2 years.

Participants: 722 pregnant Australian women experiencing adversity received NHV (n=363) or usual care (clinic visits) (n=359).

Primary and secondary outcome measures: First, a cost-consequences analysis to compare the additional costs of NHV over usual care, accounting for any reduced costs of service use, and impacts on all maternal and child outcomes assessed at 3 years. Second, cost-utility analysis from a government-as-payer perspective compared additional costs to maternal QALYs to express cost-effectiveness in terms of additional cost per additional QALY gained.

Results: When compared with usual care at child age 3 years, the right@home intervention cost $A7685 extra per woman (95% CI $A7006 to $A8364) and generated 0.01 more QALYs (95% CI -0.01 to 0.02). The probability of right@home being cost-effective by child age 3 years is less than 20%, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $A50 000 per QALY.

Conclusions: Benefits of NHV to parenting at 2 years and maternal health and well-being at 3 years translate into marginal maternal QALY gains. Like previous cost-effectiveness results for NHV programmes, right@home is not cost-effective at 3 years. Given the relatively high up-front costs of NHV, long-term follow-up is needed to assess the accrual of health and economic benefits over time.",10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A regular RCT,722,"The study did not show statistically significant results.

NSW Behavioural Insights,Reducing missed hospital appointments with better text messages,2019,"Reducing missed hospital appointments with better text messages
Each year thousands of patients miss their outpatient appointments at hospitals. St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital wanted to reduce the number of missed hospitals appointments even further and reached out to us to see if behavioural insights could be used to achieve this. 


Listen
While St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital send reminder text messages to patients to remind them of their outpatient appointments, nearly 15 per cent of people still miss their appointments. Each missed appointment reduces patient care and costs the hospital money.

Our research that found it wasn‚Äôt enough to send a reminder text message - the content of the message also matters.

We worked with St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital to test different types of text message reminders to see which one was the most effective at getting people to attend their appointment.

Two randomised controlled trials were conducted. Each trial ran for six-months over a 13-month period and included nearly two-thirds of all outpatient appointments at the hospital. During the two trials around 20,000 text messages were sent to nearly 7,500 people.

First trial
In the first trial, seven new messages were developed. The new messages built on the original text message reminder sent by St Vincent‚Äôs Hospitals.

 

Version	Text message
Original	You have an appointment with Dr [XXXX] in [clinic XXXX] on [date] at [time]. For enquiries, call 8382‚Äì3150. Do not reply.
Version 1	Original Message + Last year the hospital lost $500,000 due to lost appointments.
Version 2	Original Message + If you do not attend the hospital loses $125.
Version 3	Original Message + If you do not attend the hospital loses $125 that can be used to treat other patients.
Version 4	Original Message + If you attend the hospital will not lose the $125 we lose when a patient does not show up.
Version 5	Original Message + By attending the hospital will not lose the $125 that we lose when a patient does not turn up. This money will be used to treat other patients.
Version 6	Original Message + You are free not to attend but please call us on 8382‚Äì3150 if you need to cancel or rearrange.
Version 7	Original Message + Please attend or call 8382‚Äì3150 to cancel/rearrange, or we will record as a missed appt.
 

The two most effective messages were Versions 4 and 5.

Second trial
The second trial tested four messages: the two most effective messages from the first trial and two new messages which focused on non-financial impacts that missed appointments have on clinics and staff.

 

Version	Text message
Version 8	We are expecting you at [clinic XXXXXX] on [day] [date] at [time]. If you do not attend, St Vincent‚Äôs loses the ability to treat others in need of our services. Please call 8382‚Äì3150 if you need to cancel or rearrange.
Version 9	We are expecting you at [clinic XXXXXX] on [day] [date] at [time]. Your clinic is depending on you to attend. Please call 8382‚Äì3150 if you need to cancel or rearrange.
 

While all of the messages in the second trial led to a reduction in people missing their appointments, the most effective message was Version 5:

You have an appointment with Dr [XXXX] in [clinic XXXX] on [date] at [time]. By attending the hospital will not lose the $125 that we lose when a patient does not turn up. This money will be used to treat other patients.

During the first trial there was a 19 per cent reduction in the number of the people missing their appointments, which saved St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital over $68,000.
