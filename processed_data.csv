Objective  To assess the sustainability of effects of a home-based early intervention on children‚Äôs body mass index (BMI) and BMI z score at 3 years after intervention.

Design, Setting, and Participants  A longitudinal follow-up study of the randomized clinical Healthy Beginnings Trial was conducted with 465 participating mothers consenting to be followed up at 3 years after intervention until their children were age 5 years. This study was conducted in socially and economically disadvantaged areas of Sydney, Australia, from March 2011 to June 2014.

Interventions  No further intervention was carried out in this Healthy Beginnings Trial phase 2 follow-up study. The original intervention in phase 1 comprised 8 home visits from community nurses delivering a staged home-based intervention, with one visit in the antenatal period and 7 visits at 1, 3, 5, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after birth.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Primary outcomes were children‚Äôs BMI and BMI z score. Secondary outcomes included dietary behaviors, quality of life, physical activity, and TV viewing time of children and their mothers.

Results  In total, 369 mothers and their children completed the follow-up study, a phase 2 completion rate of 79.4% (80.9% for the intervention group and 77.7% for the control group). The differences between the intervention and control groups at age 2 years in children‚Äôs BMI and BMI z score disappeared over time. At age 2 years, the difference (intervention minus control) in BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was ‚àí0.41 (95% CI, ‚àí0.71 to ‚àí0.10; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.009), but by age 5 years it was 0.03 (95% CI, ‚àí0.30 to 0.37). No effects of the early intervention on dietary behaviors, quality of life, physical activity, and TV viewing time were detected at age 5 years.

Conclusions and Relevance  The significant effect of this early life home-visiting intervention on child BMI and BMI z score at age 2 years was not sustained at age 5 years without further intervention.

Methods: In 2010, we conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of 830 families with children attending preschools and long day care centers in South West Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Families received the Buckle-Up Safely program in the intervention arm of the study (13 services). Independent observers assessed the type of restraint and whether it was used correctly.

Results: This detailed process evaluation showed that the multifaceted program was implemented with high fidelity. Program protocols were adhered to and messaging was consistently delivered. Results from multilevel and logistic regression analyses show that age-appropriate restraint use was associated with attendance at a parent information session hosted at the center (adjusted odd ratio [AOR]=3.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.61, 8.29) and adversely affected by the child being aged 2 to 3 years (AOR=0.14; 95% CI=0.07, 0.30) or being from a family with more than 2 children (AOR=0.34; 95% CI=0.17, 0.67).

"Taft, A.J., Hooker, L., Humphreys, C.¬†et al.",Maternal And Child Health Nurse Screening And Care For Mothers Experiencing Domestic Violence (Move): A Cluster Randomised Trial,2015,"Background
Mothers are at risk of domestic violence (DV) and its harmful consequences postpartum. There is no evidence to date for sustainability of DV screening in primary care settings. We aimed to test whether a theory-informed, maternal and child health (MCH) nurse-designed model increased and sustained DV screening, disclosure, safety planning and referrals compared with usual care.

Methods
Cluster randomised controlled trial of 12 month MCH DV screening and care intervention with 24 month follow-up.

The study was set in community-based MCH nurse teams (91 centres, 163 nurses) in north-west Melbourne, Australia.

Eight eligible teams were recruited. Team randomisation occurred at a public meeting using opaque envelopes. Teams were unable to be blinded.

The intervention was informed by Normalisation Process Theory, the nurse-designed good practice model incorporated nurse mentors, strengthened relationships with DV services, nurse safety, a self-completion maternal health screening checklist at three or four month consultations and DV clinical guidelines. Usual care involved government mandated face-to-face DV screening at four weeks postpartum and follow-up as required.

Primary outcomes were MCH team screening, disclosure, safety planning and referral rates from routine government data and a postal survey sent to 10,472 women with babies ‚â§ 12 months in study areas. Secondary outcomes included DV prevalence (Composite Abuse Scale, CAS) and harm measures (postal survey).

Results
No significant differences were found in routine screening at four months (IG 2,330/6,381 consultations (36.5 %) versus CG 1,792/7,638 consultations (23.5 %), RR = 1.56 CI 0.96‚Äì2.52) but data from maternal health checklists (n = 2,771) at three month IG consultations showed average screening rates of 63.1 %. Two years post-intervention, IG safety planning rates had increased from three (RR 2.95, CI 1.11‚Äì7.82) to four times those of CG (RR 4.22 CI 1.64‚Äì10.9). Referrals remained low in both intervention groups (IGs) and comparison groups (CGs) (<1 %).

2,621/10,472 mothers (25 %) returned surveys. No difference was found between arms in preference or comfort with being asked about DV or feelings about self.

Conclusion
A nurse-designed screening and care model did not increase routine screening or referrals, but achieved significantly increased safety planning over 36 months among postpartum women. Self-completion DV screening was welcomed by nurses and women and contributed to sustainability.

"Burford et al.,",Internet-Based Photoaging Within Australian Pharmacies to Promote Smoking Cessation: Randomised Controlled Trial,2013,"Background:
Tobacco smoking leads to death or disability and a drain on national resources. The literature suggests that cigarette smoking continues to be a major modifiable risk factor for a variety of diseases and that smokers aged 18-30 years are relatively resistant to antismoking messages due to their widely held belief that they will not be lifelong smokers.

Objective:
To conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a computer-generated photoaging intervention to promote smoking cessation among young adult smokers within a community pharmacy setting.

Methods:
A trial was designed with 80% power based on the effect size observed in a published pilot study; 160 subjects were recruited (80 allocated to the control group and 80 to the intervention group) from 8 metropolitan community pharmacies located around Perth city center in Western Australia. All participants received standardized smoking cessation advice. The intervention group participants were also digitally photoaged by using the Internet-based APRIL Face Aging software so they could preview images of themselves as a lifelong smoker and as a nonsmoker. Due to the nature of the intervention, the participants and researcher could not be blinded to the study. The main outcome measure was quit attempts at 6-month follow-up, both self-reported and biochemically validated through testing for carbon monoxide (CO), and nicotine dependence assessed via the Fagerström scale.

Results:
At 6-month follow-up, 5 of 80 control group participants (6.3%) suggested they had quit smoking, but only 1 of 80 control group participants (1.3%) consented to, and was confirmed by, CO validation. In the intervention group, 22 of 80 participants (27.5%) reported quitting, with 11 of 80 participants (13.8%) confirmed by CO testing. This difference in biochemically confirmed quit attempts was statistically significant (χ21=9.0, P=.003). A repeated measures analysis suggested the average intervention group smoking dependence score had also significantly dropped compared to control participants (P<.001). These differences remained statistically significant after adjustment for small differences in gender distribution and nicotine dependence between the groups. The mean cost of implementing the intervention was estimated at AU $5.79 per participant. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was AU $46 per additional quitter. The mean cost that participants indicated they were willing to pay for the digital aging service was AU $20.25 (SD 15.32).

Conclusions:

This is the second of four reports evaluating the J2SI project. It documents the social outcomes and the economic costs and benefits from the first 24 months. The evaluation uses a randomised controlled trial that tracks the outcomes of J2SI participants (Group J) and compares their outcomes with those of a comparison group (Group E) who are being supported by existing services. After 24 months the evidence shows a sustained improvement in the housing circumstances of the J2SI participants compared to those in the control group. Critically, most (86%) have maintained their housing. While the move to independent housing was difficult in the beginning, the high rate of housing retention suggests that most of the participants are developing the skills and confidence needed to keep their housing.

"Parker et al.,",An Oral Health Literacy Intervention For Indigenous Adults In A Rural Setting In Australia,2012,"Background
Indigenous Australians suffer substantially poorer oral health than their non-Indigenous counterparts and new approaches are needed to address these disparities. Previous work in Port Augusta, South Australia, a regional town with a large Indigenous community, revealed associations between low oral health literacy scores and self-reported oral health outcomes. This study aims to determine if implementation of a functional, context-specific oral health literacy intervention improves oral health literacy-related outcomes measured by use of dental services, and assessment of oral health knowledge, oral health self-care and oral health- related self-efficacy.
Methods/design
This is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that utilises a delayed intervention design. Participants are Indigenous adults, aged 18 years and older, who plan to reside in Port Augusta or a nearby community for the next two years. The intervention group will receive the intervention from the outset of the study while the control group will be offered the intervention 12 months following their enrolment in the study. The intervention consists of a series of five culturally sensitive, oral health education workshops delivered over a 12 month period by Indigenous project officers. Workshops consist of presentations, hands-on activities, interactive displays, group discussions and role plays. The themes addressed in the workshops are underpinned by oral health literacy concepts, and incorporate oral health-related self-efficacy, oral health-related fatalism, oral health knowledge, access to dental care and rights and entitlements as a patient. Data will be collected through a self-report questionnaire at baseline, at 12 months and at 24 months. The primary outcome measure is oral health literacy. Secondary outcome measures include oral health knowledge, oral health self-care, use of dental services, oral health-related self-efficacy and oral health-related fatalism.
Discussion
This study uses a functional, context-specific oral health literacy intervention to improve oral health literacy-related outcomes amongst rural-dwelling Indigenous adults.

- non-professional mentor support to reduce intimate 
partner violence and depression in mothers: a cluster 
randomised trial in primary care.",2011,"BACKGROUND: Effective interventions to increase safety and wellbeing of mothers experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) are scarce. As much attention is focussed on professional intervention, this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of non-professional mentor support in reducing IPV and depression among pregnant and recent mothers experiencing, or at risk of IPV.

METHODS: MOSAIC was a cluster randomised trial in 106 primary care (maternal and child health nurse and general practitioner) clinics in Melbourne, Australia. 63/106 clinics referred 215 eligible culturally and linguistically diverse women between January 2006 and December 2007. 167 in the intervention (I) arm, and 91 in the comparison (C) arm. 174 (80.9%) were recruited. 133 (76.4%) women (90 I and 43 C) completed follow-up at 12 months.

INTERVENTION: 12 months of weekly home visiting from trained and supervised local mothers, (English & Vietnamese speaking) offering non-professional befriending, advocacy, parenting support and referrals.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes; IPV (Composite Abuse Scale CAS) and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale EPDS); secondary measures included wellbeing (SF-36), parenting stress (PSI-SF) and social support (MOS-SF) at baseline and follow-up.

ANALYSIS: Intention-to-treat using multivariable logistic regression and propensity scoring.

RESULTS: There was evidence of a true difference in mean abuse scores at follow-up in the intervention compared with the comparison arm (15.9 vs 21.8, AdjDiff -8.67, CI -16.2 to -1.15). There was weak evidence for other outcomes, but a trend was evident favouring the intervention: proportions of women with CAS scores ‚â• 7, 51/88 (58.4%) vs 27/42 (64.3%) AdjOR 0.47, CI 0.21 to 1.05); depression (EPDS score ‚â• 13) (19/85, 22% (I) vs 14/43, 33% (C); AdjOR 0.42, CI 0.17 to 1.06); physical wellbeing mean scores (PCS-SF36: AdjDiff 2.79; CI -0.40 to 5.99); mental wellbeing mean scores (MCS-SF36: AdjDiff 2.26; CI -1.48 to 6.00). There was no observed effect on parenting stress. 82% of women mentored would recommend mentors to friends in similar situations.

"Sherman et al.,",Experiments in restorative policing: Final report - Canberra Reintegrative Shaming Experiments (RISE),2011,"This report describes the results of the first three years‚Äô research on the largest criminological field
experiment ever conducted in Australia, and one of the largest world-wide. RISE, the
Reintegrative Shaming Experiments, compare the effects of standard court processing with the
effects of a diversionary conference for four kinds of cases:
‚Ä¢ drink driving (over .08 Blood Alcohol Content) at any age
‚Ä¢ juvenile property offending with personal victims
‚Ä¢ juvenile shoplifting offences detected by store security officers
‚Ä¢ youth violent crimes (under age 30)
The diversionary conferences consisted of a meeting between the offender and at least some
family or friends of the offender, the usual presence of the victim or (in the case of drink driving)
a community representative, and a police officer who facilitated the meeting. These often highly
emotional meetings, which took roughly 90 minutes (compared to around ten minutes for court
cases), addressed these issues in this order:
‚Ä¢ what the offender did
‚Ä¢ the harm it caused
‚Ä¢ the worse harm it could have caused
‚Ä¢ ways to repair the harm
‚Ä¢ a written agreement between police and offender on exactly what the offender will do to
repair the harm
These are the three central hypotheses of the experiment:
1. Both offenders and victims find conferences to be fairer than court
2. There will be less repeat offending after a conference than after a court treatment.
3. The public costs of providing a conference are no greater than, and perhaps less than, the
costs of processing offenders in court.
The present report addresses only the first of the three hypotheses. Data on the second and third
hypotheses are still being collected, and insufficient data are presently available on those
hypotheses to produce even a preliminary report. All findings described in this report are also
subject to modification as additional data are collected and analysed.
The findings from direct treatment observations are based upon the completion of at least one
independent observation report for 86 percent of drink driving offenders, 66 percent of Juvenile
Personal Property offenders, 75 percent of Juvenile Property (Security) offenders, and 68 percent
of Youth Violent Crime offenders. The findings from offender interviews are based upon
completion rates of 85 percent for drink driving offenders, 76 percent of Juvenile Personal
Property offenders, 73 percent of Juvenile Property (Security) offenders, and 72 percent of Youth
Violent Crime offenders. The findings from victim interviews are based upon completion rates of
87 percent for Juvenile Personal Property victims and 82 percent of Violent Crime victims.
ii EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The following summarises the key findings from the experiment to date:
1. The Experimental Sample Is A Highly Active Group of Repeat Offenders
At the time that the more than 1100 offenders in this experiment were referred by police officers
after an arrest, the offenders self-reported the following levels of offending:
‚Ä¢ Drink drivers admit to an average of 19 occasions of drink driving in the year preceding their
RISE offence.
‚Ä¢ Eighty percent of all drink drivers in the sample admit to at least one prior occasion of drink
driving in the preceding year.
‚Ä¢ Juvenile personal property offenders admitted to around 50 prior offences in the year before
entering RISE, most of them property crimes, with an average of two police contacts.
‚Ä¢ Seventy percent of juvenile personal property offenders admitted to prior property offending
and over half to prior violent offending in the preceding year.
‚Ä¢ Juvenile property (security) offenders admit to about 40 offences in the preceding year, mostly
property crimes, with an average of one police contact.
‚Ä¢ Youth Violence Offenders admitted to about 22 offences in the preceding year, including an
average of two violent offences and an average of one prior police contact for a violent offence.
2. The Offender Sample Uses Alcohol and Marijuana at High Rates
‚Ä¢ The average BAC of drink drivers in the experiment was .12.
‚Ä¢ Half of the drink driving offenders report using marijuana on occasion; 15% are daily marijuana
users
‚Ä¢ Almost no drink drivers admitted using heroin or cocaine
‚Ä¢ More than half of the juvenile and youth offenders report using alcohol 2-3 days per month or
less
‚Ä¢ Over half of the juvenile and youth offenders report using marijuana at least occasionally, and
some regularly.
3. Victims Suffered Substantial Harm
‚Ä¢ Medical treatment was required because of the offences against 62 percent of the youth violence
victims, almost all of them in a hospital emergency centre.
‚Ä¢ About seventy percent of property crime victims suffered financial harm.
‚Ä¢ Emotional harm commonly included increased suspicion and fear.
4. Conferences Treated Victims Better Than Court
‚Ä¢ Property crime victims were notified in good time for 77% of the conferences but only 15% of
the court cases.
‚Ä¢ Violent crime victims were notified in good time for 75% of the conferences but only 36% of
the court cases.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY iii
‚Ä¢ In 81% of the property crime conferences but only 5% of the property court appearances, the
victim was present at the proceedings.
‚Ä¢ In violence cases, 91% of the victims were in attendance at conference cases but only 13% were
present at the court cases.
‚Ä¢ Victims received apologies from offenders in none of the court proceedings, but victims whose
cases were heard at conference received apologies in 67% of the property cases and 82% of the
violence cases.
5. Conferences Differed From Court In Many Ways
Based on systematic observations of both court and conference by independent observers, great
differences were found on the following dimensions:
‚Ä¢ Time and effort given to justice: much more for conferences than court
‚Ä¢ Participants: many more in conferences
‚Ä¢ Emotional intensity: greater in conferences
‚Ä¢ Procedural justice: greater in conferences
‚Ä¢ Restorative justice: greater in conferences
‚Ä¢ Retributive justice: greater in court
‚Ä¢ Reintegrative shaming: greater in conferences
‚Ä¢ Stigmatic shaming: greater in conferences
‚Ä¢ Defiance: somewhat greater in conferences
‚Ä¢ Apologies: many in conferences, none in court
‚Ä¢ Forgiveness: much more in conferences
‚Ä¢ Discussion of drug and alcohol problems: more in conferences.
6. Offenders Found Conferences More Stressful Than Court
‚Ä¢ Conferences are more emotionally intense for offenders than court
‚Ä¢ Drink drivers report significantly higher levels of embarrassment and shame from being
criticised in conferences than in court.
7. Most Victims Said Conferences Were Fairer Than Court
‚Ä¢ Victims' sense of restorative justice was higher among conference victims than court victims.
‚Ä¢ Victims sense of procedural fairness was high among conference victims, but not measurable
among court victims because they so rarely attended proceedings.
‚Ä¢ Healing of the victims' emotional harm was substantial among conference victims for both
property and violence cases.
‚Ä¢ Reconciliation of the victim and the offender was far greater in conference cases than in court
for both property and violence experiments
iv EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
‚Ä¢ Victims were less likely to fear repeat victimisation by the offender after conference cases than
after court cases.
‚Ä¢ Legitimacy of the law and respect for the police was mixed between different experiments.
Property victims reported higher respect for police after conference cases than after court cases,
although violence victims did not.
‚Ä¢ Satisfaction with the way their case was handled was somewhat greater for conference than
court cases among property victims, but there was no difference among violence victims.
8. Offenders Said Conferences Were Fairer Than Court
‚Ä¢ Offenders reported higher levels of most dimensions of procedural fairness after conferences
than after court.
‚Ä¢ Drink drivers saw the penalty as too hard more often in court than in conference, and were
more often angry after court.
‚Ä¢ Youth and juvenile offenders reported no less sense of retributive punishment in conference than
in court.
‚Ä¢ Offenders reported much higher levels of restorative justice, or the opportunity to repair the
harm they had caused by their crimes, after conferences than after court appearances.
‚Ä¢ Offenders reported more dimensions of reintegrative shaming after conferences than after
court, including a greater sense of forgiveness.
‚Ä¢ Offenders report little evidence of defiance in either treat",,"Police, Justice",Australian Federal Police,,,,,,,,,,,Original database,,,,Restorative Justice,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,1100,The study does not explicitly mention statistically significant results in the provided description.

"Waters et al.,",An Exploratory Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial Of Knowledge Translation Strategies To Support Evidence-Informed Decision-Making In Local Governments (The Kt4lg Study),2011,"Background
Childhood overweight and obesity is the most prevalent and, arguably, politically complex child health problem internationally. Governments, communities and industry have important roles to play, and are increasingly expected to deliver an evidence-informed system-wide prevention program. However, efforts are impeded by a lack of organisational access to and use of research evidence. This study aims to identify feasible, acceptable and ideally, effective knowledge translation (KT) strategies to increase evidence-informed decision-making in local governments, within the context of childhood obesity prevention as a national policy priority.

Methods/Design
This paper describes the methods for KT4LG, a cluster randomised controlled trial which is exploratory in nature, given the limited evidence base and methodological advances. KT4LG aims to examine a program of KT strategies to increase the use of research evidence in informing public health decisions in local governments. KT4LG will also assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. The intervention program comprises a facilitated program of evidence awareness, access to tailored research evidence, critical appraisal skills development, networking and evidence summaries and will be compared to provision of evidence summaries alone in the control program. 28 local governments were randomised to intervention or control, using computer generated numbers, stratified by budget tertile (high, medium or low). Questionnaires will be used to measure impact, costs, and outcomes, and key informant interviews will be used to examine processes, feasibility, and experiences. Policy tracer studies will be included to examine impact of intervention on policies within relevant government policy documents.

Discussion
Knowledge translation intervention studies with a focus on public health and prevention are very few in number. Thus, this study will provide essential data on the experience of program implementation and evaluation of a system-integrated intervention program employed within the local government public health context. Standardised programs of system, organisational and individual KT strategies have not been described or rigorously evaluated. As such, the findings will make a significant contribution to understanding whether a facilitated program of KT strategies hold promise for facilitating evidence-informed public health decision making within complex multisectoral government organisations.",,"Public Health

Design Randomised controlled trial.

Setting/participants 208 (111 intervention, 97 comparison) eligible at-risk mothers living in a socioeconomically disadvantaged area in Sydney, booking into the local public hospital for confinement.

Intervention A sustained and structured nurse home visiting antenatal and postnatal parenting education and support programme.

Control Usual universal care.

Main outcome measures The quality of the home environment for child development (12–24 months), parent–child interaction and child mental, psychomotor and behavioural development at 18 months.

Results Mothers receiving the intervention were more emotionally and verbally responsive (HOME observation) during the first 2 years of their child's life than comparison group mothers (mean difference 0.5; 95% CI 0.1 to 0.9).

"Purcell et al.,",Is education an effective management strategy for reducing cancer-related fatigue?,2011,"Purpose
The use of education is recommended to teach patients self-care behaviours to reduce cancer-related fatigue, however, there is little evidence of its effectiveness or optimal timing. This educationally based cancer-related fatigue intervention trial, CAN-FIT, aimed to reduced severity of fatigue in radiotherapy patients.

Methods
One hundred and ten participants aged ≥18 years undergoing curative radiotherapy were randomly assigned to receive (1) pre- and post-radiotherapy fatigue education and support (RFES); (2) pre-RFES only; (3) post-RFES only; or (4) no RFES (standard care). Data collection occurred at pre- and post- radiotherapy and at 6-weeks follow-up.

Results
The intervention was not associated with reduction in fatigue levels at any assessment point. Significant changes were seen with secondary activity-based outcomes: Physical activity participation: Pre-RFES was associated with significantly greater increase in vigorous [Assessment (Ax)1-Ax2: 1.05 (0.24, 1.86) p < 0.01: Ax2–Ax3: 1.24, (0.44, 2.03) p < 0.01] and moderate physical activity participation [Ax1–Ax2: 1.4 (0.53, 2.26) p < 0.01]. Post-RFES was associated with significant improvements in walking levels [Ax1–Ax3: 5.82 (0.07, 11.56) p < 0.05] compared with no pre-RFES. Paid and unpaid employment: Pre-RFES was associated with slower return to pre-treatment levels of paid work [Ax2–Ax3: −0.72 (−1.41, −0.04) p < 0.05] than no pre-RFES. Post-RFES was associated with decreased levels of unpaid work [Ax1–Ax3: 561.79 (51.21, 1,072.37) p < 0.05] compared with no post-RFES.

Conclusion
The CAN-FIT programme did not significantly improve the primary outcome, level of fatigue, regardless of when it was delivered, however, significant changes were observed in activity-based outcomes. Further investigations into educationally based programmes should target activity participation rather than changes in underlying fatigue to improve overall patient health.",10.1007/s00520-010-0970-2,Health,,,,,,,,,,,,Original database,,,,Healthcare Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,110,The study did not show statistically significant results for the primary outcome of reducing cancer
"Skouteris et al.,",Healthy Eating And Obesity Prevention For Preschoolers: A Randomised Controlled Trial,2010,"Background
Developing effective prevention and intervention programs for the formative preschool years is seen as an essential step in combating the obesity epidemic across the lifespan. The overall goal of the current project is to measure the effectiveness of a healthy eating and childhood obesity prevention intervention, the MEND (Mind Exercise Nutrition Do It!) program that is delivered to parents of children aged 2-4 years.
Methods/Design
This randomised controlled trial will be conducted with 200 parents and their 2-4 year old children who attend the MEND 2-4 program in metropolitan and regional Victoria. Parent-child dyads will attend ten 90-minute group workshops. These workshops focus on general nutrition, as well as physical activity and behaviours. They are typically held at community or maternal and child health centres and run by a MEND 2-4 trained program leader. Child eating habits, physical activity levels and parental behaviours and cognitions pertaining to nutrition and physical activity will be assessed at baseline, the end of the intervention, and at 6 and 12 months post the intervention. Informed consent will be obtained from all parents, who will then be randomly allocated to the intervention or wait-list control group.
Discussion
Our study is the first RCT of a healthy eating and childhood obesity prevention intervention targeted specifically to Australian parents and their preschool children aged 2-4 years. It responds to the call by experts in the area of childhood obesity and child health that prevention of overweight in the formative preschool years should focus on parents, given that parental beliefs, attitudes, perceptions and behaviours appear to impact significantly on the development of early overweight. This is 'solution-oriented' rather than 'problem-oriented' research, with its focus being on prevention rather than intervention. If this is a positive trial, the MEND2-4 program can be implemented as a national program.",10.1186/1471-2458-10-220,Education; Public Health,,,,,,,,,,,,Original database,,,,Public Health,This is a protocol / pre-analysis plan.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,200,I'm unsure.

"Joachim et al.,","Reducing Preschoolers‚Äô Disruptive Behaviour 
in Public with a Brief Parent Discussion Group",2009,"Background
Interventions to promote positive parenting are often reported to offer good outcomes for children but they can consume substantial resources and they require rigorous appraisal.
Methods
Evaluations of the Triple P parenting program were subjected to systematic review and meta-analysis with analysis of biases. PsychInfo, Embase and Ovid Medline were used as data sources. We selected published articles reporting any child-based outcome in which any variant of Triple P was evaluated in relation to a comparison condition. Unpublished data, papers in languages other than English and some book chapters were not examined. Studies reporting Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory or Child Behavior Checklist scores as outcomes were used in the meta-analysis.
Results
A total of 33 eligible studies was identified, most involving media-recruited families. Thirty-one of these 33 studies compared Triple P interventions with waiting list or no-treatment comparison groups. Most papers only reported maternal assessments of child behavior. Twenty-three papers were incorporated in the meta-analysis. No studies involved children younger than two-years old and comparisons of intervention and control groups beyond the duration of the intervention were only possible in five studies. For maternally-reported outcomes the summary effect size was 0.61 (95%CI 0.42, 0.79). Paternally-reported outcomes following Triple P intervention were smaller and did not differ significantly from the control condition (effect size 0.42 (95%CI -0.02, 0.87)). The two studies involving an active control group showed no between-group differences. There was limited evidence of publication bias, but there was substantial selective reporting bias, and preferential reporting of positive results in article abstracts. Thirty-two of the 33 eligible studies were authored by Triple-P affiliated personnel. No trials were registered and only two papers contained conflict of interest statements.
Conclusions
In volunteer populations over the short term, mothers generally report that Triple P group interventions are better than no intervention, but there is concern about these results given the high risk of bias, poor reporting and potential conflicts of interest. We found no convincing evidence that Triple P interventions work across the whole population or that any benefits are long-term. Given the substantial cost implications, commissioners should apply to parenting programs the standards used in assessing pharmaceutical interventions.

Early Childhood Behavioural Problems: Cluster Randomised Trial",2008,"Objective To determine whether a parenting programme, offered universally in primary care, can prevent behavioural problems in children and improve parenting and maternal mental health.

Design Cluster randomised trial.

Setting 40 primary care nursing centres (clusters) in Victoria, Australia.

Participants 733 English speaking mothers of 8 month old children sequentially recruited from well child appointments; 656 retained at 24 months.

Intervention Structured three session programme at age 8-15 months, co-led by well child providers and a parenting expert. The programme covered normal development and behaviour, strategies to increase desired behaviour, and strategies to reduce unwanted behaviour.

Main outcome measures Maternal report of child externalising behaviour (child behavior checklist 1½-5 year old), parenting (parent behavior checklist), and maternal mental health (depression anxiety stress scales) at 18 and 24 months.

Results At 18 months, child behaviour and parenting scores were similar in the two groups. At 24 months, externalising scores in the intervention and control groups were similar (mean 11.9 (SD 7.2) v 12.9 (7.4)); however, on the parent behavior checklist subscale scores, intervention group parents were less likely to report harsh/abusive parenting (mean 38.9 (SD 7.7) v 40.5 (8.8); adjusted mean difference −1.83, 95% confidence interval −3.12 to −0.55) and unreasonable expectations of child development (40.9 (9.9) v 42.7 (9.6); −2.18, −3.74 to −0.62). Mean scores for nurturing parenting and maternal mental health were similar in the two groups at both times.

"Wen et al.,","Increasing Active Travel To School: Are We On The Right Track? A Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial From Sydney, Australia",2008,"Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of a program to increase walking to and from school.
Design
A cluster randomised controlled trial.
Setting
24 primary public schools in inner west Sydney, Australia.
Participants
1996 students aged 10–12 years and their parents.
Intervention
A two-year multi-component program included classroom activities, development of school Travel Access Guides, parent newsletters and improving environments with local councils.
Measures
Two measures were used: a survey completed by students on how they travelled to and from school over five days, and a survey completed by their parents on how their child travelled to and from school in a usual week.
Results
The percentage of students who walked to and from school increased in both the intervention and control schools. Data from parent surveys found that 28.8% of students in the intervention group increased their walking, compared with 19% in the control group (a net increase of 9.8%, p = 0.05). However this effect was not evident in the student data.

Parents of children aged 2 to 8 years were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: the usual Group Triple P program, consisting of four group sessions and four telephone calls (n = 16); a modified Group Triple P condition, consisting of just the four group sessions (n = 17); or a waitlist control condition (n = 16). Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted using the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and the Parenting Scale (PS). Statistically and clinically significant main effects were found for attending either the full Triple P or the modified Triple P program on both the DASS and the ECBI, but not on the participant's perception of their parenting style (PS). We conclude that (a) the four telephone sessions are not an essential component for the initial effectiveness of the Group Triple P program (though further research needs to explore whether they impact on maintenance of gains), and (b) that Group Triple P is effective in bringing about change, as measured using these self-report instruments.",10.1375/bech.2005.22.2.71,"Parenting,

Method: A population‐based randomised controlled trial using linked hospital, cancer and death records to evaluate outcomes in 620 intervention and 6,736 control subjects.
Results: The intervention group had a higher rate of first‐time hospitalisation for any reason (IRR=1.37; 95% Cl 1.25‐1.50), a higher rate of injury‐related hospital episodes (IRR=1.31; 95% Cl 1.15‐1.48) and a higher notification rate of alcoholrelated cancers There was a smaller difference in the rates of multiple hospitalisations (IRR=1.14; 95% Cl 0.75‐1.74) and no improvement in overall mortality compared with controls (IRR=1.08; 95% Cl 0.91‐1.29).
Conclusions: There was no overall mortality benefit despite increased health service contact associated with the intervention.

Slee and Rigby (1993; Slee, 1995) found that while most of these episodes of bullying last for a day or two, 17% last for 6 months or more. Australian primary-school children of both genders report being bullied more often than secondary-school students, with more boys than girls bullying others and being bullied (Rigby and Slee, 1991; Rigby, 1997; Rigby and Slee, 1998).

Despite Australian schools' increasing need systematically to address bullying, prior to 1999 no system-level, evidence-based recommendations or state curriculum materials to help to reduce bullying were available. Many school staff reported that they were unsure of the effectiveness of the strategies they utilised, and often did not know what actions could be taken at a whole-school level to reduce, or prevent, the harm from student bullying.

In response to this situation, in 1999, the Curtin University, Western Australian Centre for Health Promotion Research, applied for and received funding extensively to review and synthesise international published empirical and theoretical evidence of successful school-based strategies to reduce the harm experienced by children from being bullied or bullying others.

Bogossian,The Mothers‚Äô Health Study‚ÄØ: A Randomised Controlled Trial Of A Social Support Intervention On The Health Of Mothers In The Year After Birth,2004,"The duration of the postnatal period is professionally and socially defined as extending to six weeks after birth. After this time the mother is presumed to have recovered from pregnancy and birth and can fully resume her roles. Yet up to 94% of mothers report ongoing health concerns six months after birth (Brown & Lumley, 1998) and these concerns may persist for years (MacArthur, Lewis, & Knox, 1991b). Postnatal maternal morbidity is largely hidden, it is under-reported by mothers, remains untreated, and is neglected in the provision of maternity services. Given that in Australia, over a quarter of a million women give birth each year (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2003) the potential impact of ongoing health problems for women and their families represents a serious public health problem. This study sought to address two fundamental questions. Firstly, what is the nature, extent, severity and duration of maternal morbidity in the year after childbirth? And secondly, can social support improve maternal morbidity in the year following birth? 

A randomised controlled trial was performed in Ipswich and Redcliffe/Caboolture Health Districts of Queensland, Australia to determine the effect of a programme of postnatal emotional social support provided by Research Midwives on the prevalence, severity and duration of maternal health concerns in the first year after birth. One hundred and thirty five women gave informed consent to participate in the trial, and these women were eligible for inclusion, as they had all given birth to live term infants during the specified recruitment period. Simple randomisation was performed resulting in balanced groups. The retention rates at completion of the trial were 71% and 61% for the intervention and control groups respectively. 

The intervention was a programme of home visits and telephone calls by, and twenty-four hour telephone access to. Research Midwives and was aimed at providing emotional social support to women. Only anxiety status appeared to be affected by the intervention with significantly more women in the intervention group remaining non-personally disturbed than in the control group at the post intervention point in time (x2.6.31, df 2, p<0.04). The intervention did not demonstrate an effect on the perceived social support, on the prevalence, nature and severity of health concerns, or on postnatal depression reported by women. The majority of women (87.7%) in the intervention group were compliant with the programme of support, however the analysis was performed on an intention to treat basis. 

Women experienced diminished general health after birth and this persisted with respect to the Role-Physical (t=-2.75, df 88, p=0.007) and Vitality (t=-4.54, df 89, p<0.001) transformed scales of the SF-36 at fifty-two weeks postpartum. Thirteen health concerns were prevalent in greater than twenty percent of women at both points in time and the severity of concerns remained stable between two and twelve months postpartum. Of the mothers who reported health concerns, 40-78% did not seek professional advice and the majority did not undertake any treatment. 

Extreme tiredness was the most prevalent health concern and persisted to affect 58.1% of mothers at twelve months. Urinary incontinence was the only concern that increased in prevalence over the study period from 35.3% at eight weeks to 46.0% at fifty-two weeks postpartum. Painful perineum and haemorrhoids were significantly associated with assisted vaginal delivery, specifically, painful perineum (OR 9.55) at eight weeks postpartum and haemorrhoids at both eight and fifty-two weeks postpartum (OR 8.80 and OR 12.00). Mothers who described the birth as ""difficult"" at fifty-two weeks were more likely to report sexual difficulties (OR 7.00). 

Method of delivery was significantly associated with pelvic health concerns at eight weeks (χ2 9.20, df 2, p=0.010) and fifty-two weeks (χ2 7.86, df 2, p=0.020) and with bowel concerns at eight weeks (χ2 10.93, df2, p=0.004). Primiparas were more likely to report sexual difficulties at eight weeks (χ2 6.44, df 3, p=0.040). 

Women with persistent neck or shoulder pain at eight and fifty-two weeks (OR 3.46 and OR 2.80) or bowel problems at eight weeks (OR 2.70) were more likely to have lower Mental Component Summary scores. At fifty-two weeks those mothers who had urinary frequency (OR 5.10), bowel problems (OR 7.32), extreme tiredness (OR 9.51), or teeth or gum problems (OR 4.62) were more likely to have lower Physical Component Summary scores. 

The presumption that social support declines over time was supported by the trend that fewer women reported increased support and more women reported diminished support. While this trend was significant for emotional social support (McNemar's p=0.009) it was evident for informational and functional subscales of social support. While the social support intervention did not produce a statistically significant effect, no negative impacts were demonstrated. The experiences of the key stakeholders in the study provide evidence of the positive non-quantifiable outcomes of study involvement. The positive impact of social support was evident in that women who reported high levels of social support reported low levels of health concern severity and this trend was significant for informational support (χ2 6.48, df 88, p<0.01). Postnatal depression and anxiety were also associated with high health concern severity; the latter was significantly associated (χ2 19.63, df=124, p<0.01). High levels of emotional social support and low levels of anxiety appeared to enhance mental health measured by the Mental Component Summary score. 

The results of the study are unlikely to be attributed to bias or confounding and appear to be generalisable to other populations of pregnant women who exhibit the same maternal and birth characteristics and fulfil the eligibility criteria. The extent and persistent nature of, and lack of treatment seeking behaviour for ongoing health concerns in the postpartum year strongly supports the urgent need for systematic data collection and appropriate screening of women postpartum. When the results of this study are examined in light of existing research, it provides increasing support for the need for more focused research trials, and for social support interventions to be targeted to those groups who have diminished social resources.",10.14264/254235,Health; Infant and maternal health,,,,,,,,,,,,Original database,,,,Maternal Health,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,135,The study showed statistically significant results in a few areas.

Dolan,A Randomised Controlled Trial Of Methadone Maintenance Treatment In NSW Prisons,2003,"Evidence of the effectiveness of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in reducing heroin injection and HIV infection among injecting drug users (IDUs) in community settings has been well documented (Ward et al, 1998). However, many IDUs spend time in prison where approximately half continue to inject and typically share syringes (Butler et al, 1997). Yet few countries operate methadone maintenance programs for IDUs in prison.

This report documents a randomised controlled study of the NSW prison methadone program. Over 923 inmates were screened for suitability for participation in the trial. Of these, 593 were suitable and 382 agreed to take part in the study. The 382 subjects were interviewed, asked to provide a finger prick blood sample and a hair sample at recruitment and four months later. The blood samples were tested for hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV antibodies. The hair samples were tested for the presence of morphine.

Baseline characteristics: At baseline, subjects in both groups were comparable on all key demographic characteristics, prison histories, injecting drug use and sharing of injecting equipment in prison and in the community. Both groups had the same mean age (27 years), mean age first imprisoned (20 years), had been imprisoned a mean four (treated) and five (control) times, started injecting at mean age 17 years, and commenced daily injecting at mean age 19 (treated) and 18 (control) years. A quarter of both groups were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander (22%, 25%). Median length of current sentence was 1.4 years in both the treated (range 0.3-18) and control (range 0.2-21) group. The treated group was significantly more likely to report having shared syringes at some time in the community (76% vs 64%) while comparable proportions of both groups who had injected in prison reported sharing syringes (92%, 87%).

Drug use: Virtually all inmates reported injecting in the month before they entered prison (98% treated, 93% control). The most common drug injected prior to prison entry was heroin (96% treated, 90% control) followed by amphetamine (40%, 40%), cocaine (34%, 35%) and illicitly obtained methadone (26%, 23%). Most inmates in the treated group (69%) and the control group (74%) who had been in prison at least one month before being recruited into the study reported injecting heroin in prison.

Self reported HIV, HCV and HBV prevalence: No-one reported being HIV positive at entry to the study (it should be noted that this was an exclusion criterion for the study). Almost two thirds of treated (64%) and control (63%) subjects reported a previous positive hepatitis C result while one fifth (22%, 19%) of treated and control subjects reported positive hepatitis B (HBV) results. Approximately half of both groups reported having been vaccinated against HBV (49%, 48%).

HIV and HCV seroprevalence: Finger prick blood samples were assayed using an algorithm that has high correlation with assays of venous blood samples (NCCLS, 1998). HIV antibody was detected using Genetic Systems HIV-1 ELISA tests. HCV antibody was detected using a modified third generation enzyme immunoassay (Abbott HCV 3.0, Chicago II). The blood test results revealed 76% of treated and 72% of control subjects had antibodies to hepatitis C. No blood spot samples test positive for HIV.

Hair tests: Quantitative results for hair analysis (nanograms per mg of hair) were analysed. Hair samples were tested for morphine, the metabolite of heroin in the body, by Tricho- Tech Limited, Wales, UK. At baseline, one cm of hair cut from the root was analysed for morphine to assess heroin use in the previous month. The prevalence of morphine positive samples was 82% for the treated group and 83% for controls.

Follow up: The aim was to re- interview after a period of four months. Of the 382 subjects recruited into the trial, follow-up interviews were completed for 313 (82%). The rest were unavailable for follow up because they had been released from prison, declined to be re- interviewed or were incapable. Of the 162 (85%) treated and 152 (80%) control subjects who were re- interviewed, approximately one fifth (20%, 18%) of each group had been released and re-incarcerated between interviews and were excluded from main analysis. As the aim of the study was to assess the impact of methadone maintenance treatment on heroin use, syringe sharing and the prevention of blood borne viral infection (BBVI) in prison, only the 253 subjects who received a second interview and who had remained in prison are included in the current analysis. Therefore 129 (68%) of treated and 124 (65%) of control subjects who had been in continuous custody were included in the analysis for the purposes this report. The mean time period between interviews was 5.2 months for treated and 4.5 months for control subjects.

Drug use: Self- reported use of any illicit drug between interviews remained high at in both the treated and control group. At follow up, a three cm segment of hair was cut from the root, divided into three one cm sections and analysed for morphine to assess heroin use in each of the three months preceding the follow up interview. Hair samples reflecting the first month after recruitment were not tested. This month allowed inmates on methadone to reach an adequate dose (eg 60mg). When determined by both hair morphine concentration and self report, heroin use was significantly lower in the treated group at month two, three and four of follow up compared to the control group. Treated subjects also reported a significantly lower mean number of heroin injections in each month of follow up compared to controls.

Needle and syringe sharing: Treated subjects reported significantly less needle and syringe sharing at follow up compared to control subjects. There was no difference in the median number of sharing partners reported by treated compared to control subjects.

Seroconversion: Four subjects in both groups seroconverted to HCV. No one seroconverted to HIV.

Sexual risk behaviour: One ethics committee precluded questions about sexual activity from the first interview. However sexually contact with others was rarely report at follow up (2% treatment, 2% control) and no sexual behaviour was reported with other inmates.

Conclusion: The study demonstrated that it is possible to conduct a randomised control trial of a prison methadone program. The groups were comparable at baseline. At follow up, the treatment group had benefited from being on methadone as they reported less heroin use, less injecting and less syringe sharing. Combined results from hair analysis and self report also showed less heroin use among the treated group. There were equal numbers of HCV seroconversions and no HIV seroconversions.",,"Crime

A total of 63 parents were recruited for the study with 45 parents (40 mothers and 5 fathers) from 40 families completing the project. The research design permitted comparison between the intervention and three alternative conditions with all parents receiving the intervention in an alternating sequence over the life of the project. The intervention consisted of 10 weekly lessons carried out in the parent’s home focusing on child health and home safety. The program was adapted to suit the Australian context from the UCLA Parent–Child Health and Wellness Project (Tymchuk, Groen, & Dolyniuk, 2000). Outcome measures assessed parental health and safety behaviours. Standard measures included parental health, intelligence and literacy. The intervention improved parents’ ability to recognize home dangers, to identify precautions to deal with these dangers and resulted in a significant increase in the number of safety precautions parents implemented in their homes with all gains being maintained at 3 months post-intervention. Parents’ health behaviours including improved understanding of health and symptoms of illness, knowledge of and skills needed to manage life-threatening emergencies, knowledge about visiting the doctor, knowing when to call, what information to provide and what questions to ask, and how to use medicines safely significantly increased. Again, all gains were maintained 3 months post-intervention. The intervention was effective regardless of parental health, literacy skills, and IQ.

To evaluate the relative efficacy of (1) child therapy, (2) parent/teacher training, and (3) the combination of child therapy and parent/teacher training in the treatment of anxiety-based school refusal.
Method

Sixty-one school-refusing children (aged 7–14 years) from throughout Melbourne, Australia, were randomized to a child therapy program, a parent and teacher training program, or a combination of the two. Children were assessed before and after treatment, and at 4.5-month follow-up, by means of attendance records, self-report of emotional distress and self-efficacy, parent and teacher reports of emotional distress, and clinician ratings of overall functioning.
Results

Statistically and clinically significant pretreatment-posttreatment change occurred for each group. Immediately posttreatment, child therapy appeared to be the least effective in increasing attendance. By follow-up, the attendance and adjustment of those in the child therapy group equalled that of children whose parents and teachers were involved in treatment, whether on their own (parent/ teacher training) or together with their children (combined child therapy and parent/teacher training).
Conclusion

Contrary to expectations, combined child therapy and parent/teacher training did not produce better outcomes at posttreatment or follow-up.",10.1097/00004583-200206000-00008,"Education

Parenting interventions have the potential to improve outcomes for the whole family but need evaluation of feasibility in this context. The Triple-P Self-Help Workbook was implemented with guidance and support with 10 parents experiencing psychosis in a multiple baseline case series study. Sessions were weekly and home-based. Outcome measures examined facets of parenting, child behavior, self-efficacy and parental mental health. Follow up interviews explored parents' perspectives of the perceived impact of the intervention and apparent mechanisms of change. The program resulted in clinically significant change (&gt;25% improvement) in mental health, parenting and child behavior measures post-intervention for the 50% who completed all 10 sessions and improvements were maintained at 3 and 6 month follow up. Interviews with those who completed the program revealed it to have been transformative: parents reported positive changes in parenting style; they were empowered with regard to their parenting and had a greater sense of control over their mental health. This study provides preliminary evidence that self-directed Triple P might be able to reduce the symptoms of psychosis by improving family functioning. Findings could inform the future development or adaptation of evidence-based parenting interventions for parents with psychosis in order to improve their mental health, aid recovery, and intervene early in the lives of children at risk of poor long-term outcomes.",10.3389/fpsyt.2022.791294,"Parenting,

Fifty-six parents of children aged between 2 and 8 years were randomly assigned to either watching the television series or to a waitlist control group. Compared to the control group, parents in the television viewing (TV) condition reported significantly lower levels of disruptive child behavior and higher levels of perceived parenting competence, immediately following intervention. Prior to intervention approximately 42.9% of the children in the TV condition were in the clinically elevated range for disruptive child behavioral problems. This had reduced to 14.3% following intervention. In addition, a high level of consumer acceptability was reported by parents in the TV condition. All post-intervention effects were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Implications for public health approaches to family mental health are discussed.

"Board et al.,",A Randomised Controlled Trial Of The Costs Of Hospital As Compared With Hospital In The Home For Acute Medical Patients,2000,"OBJECTIVE
To test the cost effectiveness of Hospital in the Home compared to hospital admission for acute medical conditions.
METHOD
Randomised controlled trial at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, from October 1995 to February, 1997; 100 patients with acute medical conditions admitted through the Emergency Department.
RESULTS
The Hospital in the Home (HITH) group costs per separation ($1,764, CI95%$1,416 -$2,111, n=50) were significantly lower (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U -Wilcoxon Rank Sum) than the control group hospital separation ($3,614, CI 95%$2,881.37 -$4,347.27, n=47) with no significant difference in clinical outcomes, and comparable or better user satisfaction.
CONCLUSION
Given the favourable clinical outcomes the HITH model produces at a lower cost, the cost-effectiveness of the care mode is high, and the allocative efficiency favourable.
IMPLICATIONS
As a care model and critical pathway, HITH offers hospitals real bed day savings that can either be used to rationalise resource usage for a given level of activity, or increase throughput.",10.1111/j.1467-842x.2000.tb01573.x,Health,,,,,,,,,,,,Original database,,,,Healthcare Cost-Effectiveness,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),100,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

"Mitchell et al.,",A Randomised Trial Of An Intervention To Develop Health Promoting Schools In Australia: The South Western Sydney Study,2000,"OBJECTIVE
This paper describes the evaluation of a health promoting schools intervention carried out in the south western region of Sydney, Australia. The evaluation sought to assess the project's impact on structures to support the health promoting school concept and changes in health-related policies and practices within 22 local schools.
METHODS
A randomised controlled study was employed. Intervention schools were offered seminars and training in the health promoting schools concept, encouraged to use a resource kit to help them establish their school as health promoting and invited to participate in a support network. Pre- and post measures of awareness, school structures and policies and practices to support the development of a health promoting school were taken and intervention and control schools compared.
RESULTS
There was an increased level of awareness of the health promoting school concept among intervention schools. However, there were no significant changes in health-related policies and practices at the school level, among both intervention and control schools.
CONCLUSIONS
A longer time frame and more structured support are required to influence school structures to support the development of a health promoting school.
IMPLICATIONS
To facilitate organisational change in schools, health promoting school interventions need to provide structured support for schools and recognise that change takes time. A committee to initiate action, a plan to guide work and school support are likely to facilitate the adoption of the health promoting schools approach. Further work to refine the measurement of school-based action and its outcome and the development of indicators for a health promoting school is needed.",10.1111/j.1467-842x.2000.tb01563.x,"Public Health

"Peel et al.,",Home Safety Assessment In The Prevention Of Falls Among Older People,2000,"Objective
Home safety assessment was examined as part of a randomised trial of falls prevention interventions among older community dwellers.
Method
Falls prevention strategies, including education and awareness-raising, exercise, home modifications and medical assessment, were trialled with 252 members of the National Seniors Association. Falls outcomes were monitored using a daily calendar diary during intervention and follow-up periods.
Results
The home assessment group was significantly more likely to modify their home environment than the controls (p<0.0001). Participants, regardless of group allocation, reported a significant reduction in concern about falling (p<0.0001). During the intervention, the home assessment group had lower incidence rates for falls and injuries than the control group, although differences were not significant. The lowered rates were sustained post-intervention.
Conclusions
While the effect on falls incidence of a home safety intervention on its own could not be demonstrated, other benefits, including improved confidence attributable to awareness of such falls prevention measures, were recorded.
Implication

"Fraser et al.,",Home Visiting Intervention For Vulnerable Families With Newborns: Follow-Up Results Of A Randomised Controlled Trial,2000,"Objective: This study aimed to: (1) Assess the community utility of a screening tool to identify families with child abuse or neglect risk factors in the immediate postnatal period (2) Determine the social validity and effectiveness of a home visiting program using community child health nurses and offering social work services for identified families, and (3) Identify factors in the immediate postnatal period associated with the child’s environment that predict poor adjustment to the parenting role.
Method: A randomized controlled trial using a cohort of 181 families was undertaken to evaluate the impact of a home visiting program. Mothers were recruited in the immediate postnatal period and allocated either into the home visiting program or into a comparison group. The research design required self-identification into the study by providing positive responses to a range of risk factors. A repeated measures design was used to test parenting stress and maternal depression from the immediate postnatal period to 12-month follow-up and physical child abuse potential to 18-month follow-up. To test whether measures taken in the immediate postnatal period were predictive for poor adjustment to the parenting role, a linear regression model was used.
Results: The screening procedure was shown to have utility in the context of recruitment to a research trial and mothers were willing to accept the home visiting program examined by this study from the immediate postnatal period. From as early as 6 weeks the program demonstrated ability to impact positively on maternal, infant, family, and home environment variables (testing 90 randomly allocated intervention vs. 91 comparison families). At follow-up, parental adjustment variables were not significantly different between groups (testing the remaining 68 (75.5%) intervention vs. 70 (76.9%) comparison families) and home environment assessment scores had converged. Predictive analysis of factors measured in the immediate postnatal period revealed an absence of any predictive value to demographic characteristics, which secondary prevention efforts typically target.
Conclusions: Follow-up evaluation did not demonstrate a positive impact on parenting stress, parenting competence, or quality of the home environment confirming the need to test early program success on longer term outcomes. Further, the study not only demonstrated that there was a relationship between maternal, family and environmental factors identified in the immediate postnatal period, and adjustment to the parenting role, but also challenged demographic targeting for child abuse and neglect risk. At the same time, the immediate postnatal period presented an exciting window of opportunity to access high-risk families who may otherwise have become marginalized from traditional services.",10.1016/s0145-2134(00)00193-9,"Welfare

Retailers were checked for compliance at pretest and post-test, six months apart, by twelve 18-yearolds who were judged by independent raters to look younger. The retailers were surveyed by telephone at both times for knowledge, attitudes and self-reported sales practices. Neither intervention achieved significant improvements for the two key behavioural outcomes: requiring proof of age and display of a warning sign. Neither was there an intervention effect on knowledge about the law. The greatest improvement in the proportion of retailers who believed that the legal age should be 18 or over was in the minimal-intervention group, and both intervention groups were less likely than the control group at post-test to think that it was acceptable to sell to a person who was nearly 18. There was poor overall compliance with the revised legislation at pre-test. The finding of a pretest-to-post-test improvement but no differential intervention effect highlights the methodological difficulties of such research. The interventions may, however, have been pardy successful in modifying the attitudes of retailers.

This study assessed the effectiveness of a Rational-Emotive Parent Education Program (REPE) in reducing parental stress. The REPE program focused only on core irrationalities to determine the efficacy of elegant disputation. Mothers of young children attending an early intervention centre for Down syndrome were randomly allocated to three groups, experimental, REPE, n = 21; a comparative-treatment control, Applied Behaviour Analysis, (ABA) n = 17; and a no-treatment control, n = 16. A pretest post-test design was used with there being eight seminars of both the REPE and ABA programs. On both the Profile of Mood States and the Parenting Stress Index (Parent Domain) totals the REPE group showed significant reductions in stress compared with both control groups. The results from some subscales and single items suggested that the early intervention centre program also reduced stress. The REPE program using elegant disputation reduced parental stress.

A further randomised controlled trial compared the effect of postal reminders with telephone reminders for women who did not respond to an initial invitation to participate in the program. There were 482 women in the first trial and 641 in the second. Excluding women who were ineligible or could not be contacted, participation in screening was 71 per cent in the group which received letters from their general practitioners compared with 62 per cent in the group which did not receive letters (P = 0.059). In the group that received letters, 56 per cent were screened without a reminder compared with 43 per cent of the group that did not receive letters (P = 0.01). Fewer women who received letters from their general practitioners declined the invitation to be screened (P = 0.048). In the second trial, there was no difference in participation between the group receiving telephone reminders and the group receiving postal reminders. As in breast cancer screening programs in other countries, general practitioner endorsement of invitations increased participation in breast cancer screening.

Family‐focussed interventions have been advocated to address parents’ difficulties. The present evaluation study was undertaken to ascertain long‐term outcomes of the psychoeducational support program, Caring for Parent Caregivers. The aim of the program is to empower the individual and thereby strengthen family resources. Quantitative and qualitative analytical procedures, which included the written evaluations of treatment subjects, were employed to examine program effectiveness. For the fathers and mothers of children with disabilities, psychological health and well‐being was assessed on the General Health Questionnaire, using a pretest and follow‐up control group design. Results showed a statistically significant difference between groups, 12 months after treatment, with program participants displaying less emotional distress than control group subjects. The positive direction of behavioural and attitudinal outcomes, which emerged from evaluation of the small group intervention, were similar for both mothers and fathers. Overall satisfaction with the program was very high, with useful recommendations for program development and for future research and practice being identified.

AERO & Anne Kennedy,Research gives insight into the power of early years education to improve outcomes for Australia‚Äôs most vulnerable children,2021,"By the time they start school, gaps are already apparent between children from advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds. In learning and cognition as well as social and emotional development, the gaps may increase without effective and costly later intervention.

In 2007, the Children‚Äôs Protection Society (CPS, now trading as Kids First), a child and family services agency, as well as a group of researchers from the University of Melbourne embarked on a bold and innovative research project. 

The Early Years Education Research Program (EYERP) brought together professionals with expertise in economics, statistical analysis, clinical research methodologies, social work, infant mental health, project management and early childhood curriculum and pedagogy.

The research project aimed to test the hypothesis that a 3-year, high-quality, early education program for young children living with severe family stress and social disadvantage, would enable them to enter school as confident learners, developmentally and educationally equal to their peers. The project was innovative and bold in several ways.

The project was designed as a randomised controlled trial (RCT), a design rarely used in early childhood education in Australia. RCTs are helpful because they generate rigorous evidence of the effectiveness of an approach. As part of the RCT, children were assessed before, during and after the program.

The program being studied specifically targeted families and children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Some researchers have suggested that targeted approaches may not be effective because families and children from disadvantaged backgrounds may feel marginalised or face difficulties accessing affordable, high-quality early childhood programs.

Our research showed that this was not the case. Retention rates for families and children in our research project were high. Importantly, after 24 months of the intervention, there were large positive impacts on children‚Äôs cognitive and non-cognitive development ‚Äì primarily IQ, where there was an average 7 to 8 points improvement from below average to average.

Positive impacts were also identified with protective factors related to resilience and social-emotional development. There was also some evidence that the approach improves children‚Äôs language skills and lowers the psychological distress of their primary caregivers. These findings can be trusted because of rigor in the research design and commitment to program fidelity.

The power of the EYERP is that it provides greater insight into the characteristics of high-quality education and care. This evidence supports implementing practices that will help improve outcomes for children experiencing severe family stress and social disadvantage.

Achieving remarkable outcomes for children in the intervention group in the RCT is just the beginning for this research project. Our next phase aims to replicate the approach in several new sites to determine if the same outcomes can be achieved with similar cohorts of children.

Replication with fidelity is often the missing link in early education research interventions. We need to replicate to confirm that the approach works in different contexts; to identify evidence-informed modifications to the approach, and to make recommendations to government for a stepped scaling up of the approach.

Education equity gaps demand that we do something bold, evidence informed, and much earlier for children living with significant social disadvantage and family stress factors.",,Education,,,,,,,,,Research gives insig...~https://www.edresearch.edu.au/other/articles/early-years-education-improve-outcomes,,,,,,,Early Childhood Education,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

The Better Access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners through the Medicare Benefits Schedule initiative (Better Access) provides Medicare rebates to eligible people (those with a diagnosed mental disorder) so that they can access the formal mental health support services they need.

Key findings

The target trial emulation using Ten to Men data showed no detectable effect of a higher number of Better Access treatment sessions from 2013‚Äì22 on improvements in depression symptoms in men.
Results were similar for men in priority populations (including men living in rural and remote areas and men from CALD backgrounds) and also applied to anxiety symptoms.
A higher number of Better Access treatment sessions during the COVID-19 period (2020‚Äì22) also did not appear to lead to improvements in depression symptoms during this period.
A key message for policymakers is that increasing the provision of mental health treatment alone may not be sufficient to reduce rates of mental ill-health among Australian men.

BETA & Department of Human Services,Effective use of SMS to encourage timely reporting behaviour using digital channels,2018,"BETA joined forces with the Australian Government Department of Human Services to help
job seekers report on time and receive their income support payments on time.
For Australians looking for work, Newstart Allowance and Youth Allowance (other) are the
main payments provided by the Australian Government. In 2016, these payments totalled
$10.95 billion. People who receive these payments must report their income every fortnight
to ensure they receive the correct payment. In any given fortnight over 80,000 people
(or 9 per cent) are late reporting their income and approximately 3,100 people are so late
their payments are cancelled.
Drawing on behavioural insights, we designed a trial to test if a simple and timely reminder could
make a difference. Australians live increasingly busy lives and make hundreds of decisions a
day. It can be easy to get distracted, or procrastinate and forget even the smallest and simplest
of tasks. Reminders have been shown to work in a range of contexts including healthcare,
education, financial management, and family welfare, and are often used by the private sector to
prompt on‚Äëtime payment of bills, and renewals of products and services.
Because we know people can respond differently depending on how a message is framed, we
also tested whether different reminder messages worked better than others. We designed three
types of SMS reminders sent the day before the income report was due: a short and simple
reminder (short group); a reminder emphasising the costs of not reporting (loss frame); and a
reminder making the benefits of reporting on time more salient (gain frame). We also sent each
message in a personalised and non-personalised version.
We tracked and measured the effect these messages had on income reporting and then
compared these results with people who did not receive a reminder. We found sending any
SMS reminder had a big impact, increasing the number of people who reported on time by
13.5 percentage points, with those who received an SMS reminder reporting sooner than
those who did not. Some reminders also resulted in fewer payment cancellations (down
by 1.7 percentage points).
The findings of our trial are clear: small, simple changes in service delivery make a big difference.
Introducing a simple reminder helps those looking for work to receive the income they need,
when they need it. These changes also help other Australians. By improving the efficiency
of services, resourcing can be redirected to helping others in need. In the context of Human
Services‚Äô 200 million interactions with Australians each year, these small improvements matter

shortlisted applicants for a hypothetical senior role in their agency. Participants were randomly assigned to 
receive application materials for candidates in standard form or in de-identified form (with information about

We found that the public servants engaged in positive (not negative) discrimination towards female and

BETA & Treasury,Supporting retirees in retirement income planning,2016,"This study examined how people respond to a new income plan for retirement, known as a Comprehensive Income 
Product for Retirement (CIPR). A CIPR is a composite retirement income product which is intended to provide a 
balance of income, risk management (for example, longevity risk management) and flexibility to retirees. In response 
to a Financial System Inquiry1
 recommendation, the Government has agreed to facilitate superannuation trustees 
pre-selecting a CIPR for their members at retirement. This study is a first step in building an evidence base to inform 
decisions about how best to present CIPRs to superannuation members in order to maximize comprehension, assist 
informed decision-making and alleviate cognitive load. Using insights from behavioural economics, we designed and 
tested a series of alternative presentations of information using a survey experiment based on a hypothetical CIPR. 
Over 3,600 pre-retirement members across five industry and retail superannuation funds participated in the study. 
Members were asked to review information which compared a CIPR and an Account-Based Pension (ABP) (which is 
how most retirees currently manage their superannuation in retirement). Members were randomly assigned to view 
information about the two plans in one of eight conditions ‚Äì minimal text descriptions (control); graphs showing 
estimates of income and assets over time; number tables showing numerical estimates of income and assets; text 
tables with text-based comparisons of income and assets; text tables with star ratings assigned to the plans and 
text-based comparisons of income and assets; and alternative versions of the text and number tables in which 
comparisons of income under each plan were highlighted in bold.
The results show that presenting key information in a relatively simple manner helped people to make the decision 
(as measured by comprehension, perceived clarity, decision-making ease and confidence), and made them more 
likely to choose the CIPR. Compared with the control group who viewed minimal text descriptions of the two 
plans, members who received any of the alternative information presentations, on average, exhibited much higher 
comprehension scores (3.71 compared to 2.67 out of 5 ‚Äì a 39% improvement), reported greater perceived clarity 
(3.74 vs 3.50 ‚Äì a 6.9% improvement), decision-making ease (3.54 vs 3.42 ‚Äì a 3.5% improvement), and decision 
confidence (3.50 vs 3.40 ‚Äì a 2.9% improvement), they also were more likely to choose the CIPR (52.01% vs 47.56% - 
a 9.4% improvement).
When comparing different types of presentations, text tables comparing the key features in words, rather than 
numbers alone, were consistently most effective. Tables showing numerical estimates appear to be least effective 
in general. Including star ratings or highlighting income comparisons across the plans had no impact on decisionmaking. If we were to declare an overall ‚Äúwinner‚Äù, there was only one approach, the text table (with income 
highlighted), that led to significantly improved outcomes across the board ‚Äì with improvements in comprehension, 
perceived clarity, decision-making ease, decision making confidence, and willingness to choose the CIPR. The greater 
effectiveness of text tables (versus graphs and number tables) was especially clear among women and younger 
(aged‚ÄØ45-54) individuals.
SUMMARY
BETA ‚Äî Supporting Retirees in Retirement Income Planning‚ÄÇ|‚ÄÇ 7
Members responded positively to the proposed new plan ‚Äì on average, members were around 50% willing to 
choose the CIPR if it were offered to them in the future. Given the lack of product diversity (94% of retirement 
assets in Australia are currently allocated to ABPs) and the fact that CIPRs are a new product, this level of interest is 
encouraging and suggests CIPRs may do well (in terms of customer take-up) in the market. 
Comprehension and willingness to choose the CIPR varied across segments. On average, males had slightly higher 
comprehension scores than females (3.63 vs. 3.51 out of 5 ‚Äì a 3.4% difference), and members who had consulted 
a financial planner had higher scores than those who had not (3.66 vs. 3.52 ‚Äì a 4.0% difference). Consistent with a 
bequest motive, members without children were more willing to choose the CIPR than were members with children 
(55.77% vs. 50.28%). Additionally, members who held an average or longer than average life expectancy also were 
more willing (51.43% and 53.03%, respectively) to choose the CIPR as compared to members who held a shorter 
than average life expectancy (47.72%).
Individuals generally made their choice about the CIPR in a way that aligned with their pre-stated preferences 
regarding what was most important for them. Members who prioritised income (‚ÄòI want to get the highest level of 
income in retirement, based on my superannuation balance‚Äô) or managing longevity risk (‚ÄòI want my superannuation 
to last my entire lifetime‚Äô), and deprioritised flexibility (‚ÄòI want to be able to access and use all of my superannuation 
when I want‚Ä¶‚Äô) were 18.9 to 28.83 percentage points (respectively) more likely to choose the CIPR than those who 
prioritised flexibility (expressing a contrasting preference profile). 
The findings of this survey are intended to contribute to the broader public consultation process that the 
Government is currently undertaking on the CIPRs framework2
. In particular, as our study specifically focussed 
on how to present information about CIPRs, the results might inform the regulatory framework governing how 
superannuation trustees may be required to present CIPRs to their members. We note however, that this study is 
just a first step in building an evidence base for this. As the CIPRs framework is being developed, there is opportunity 
to further test and fine-tune different approaches (informed by behavioural science) to support retirees in making 
well-informed decisions about how to best manage their retirement income",,"Financial, Superannuation",,,,,,,,,Supporting retirees ...~https://behaviouraleconomics.pmc.gov.au/projects/supporting-retirees-retirement-income-planning,,,,,,,Retirement Planning,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Regular RCT,3600,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

BETA & DSS,Encouraging survey participation to evaluate social service program outcomes,2017,"The Community Grants Hub, implemented by the Department of Social Services 
(DSS), supports the administration and delivery of over 21,000 community grants 
across government. These grants, worth around $7.8 billion, provide valuable 
support services to individuals, families and their communities across Australia. 
To enable the collection of meaningful data about service delivery outcomes from 
organisations receiving community grants, DSS introduced a new reporting platform 
called the Data Exchange. As part of this platform, DSS piloted a client survey to 
enable clients to self-report on why they sought assistance and the outcomes of 
accessing the service. We partnered with DSS to develop and test ways to 
encourage greater survey completion rates.
There are many reasons why people may not complete a survey in its entirety. 
People may not understand why the survey is important, may not anticipate how long 
it will take, or simply think the required effort is just not worth it.
To address these challenges, we incorporated small behaviourally-informed 
progress updates into the Data Exchange survey. Updates were presented in a form 
of a gradually completing pie-chart, accompanied by short messages with references 
to social norms and highlighting how completing the survey would benefit the 
individual and their community. 
We ran a trial to test whether our re-designed survey worked. We found our changes 
had a significant impact, increasing survey completion by 6.8 percentage points, 
from 84.7 per cent to 91.5 per cent.
The outcomes of this trial show how simple low-cost changes to survey design may 
increase survey completion. With many government and private organisations using 
surveys to better understand and service their clients, the significance of this finding 
extends beyond future redesigns of the Data Exchange survey and should be 
considered by other organisations looking to survey their clients",,"Social, Health",,,,,,,,,Encouraging survey participation to evaluate social service program outcomes | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,,,,,Social Services,Full study with results.,Field experiment,Unsure,The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

BETA & Department of Energy,Electricity information to fit the bill: redesigning electricity bills to support consumer engagement,2018,"Part of the reason for this is the difficulty in comparing offers, with many consumers reporting 
they are not confident making choices in the electricity market. The ACCC‚Äôs recent Electricity 
supply and prices inquiry highlights there is unnecessary complexity in the way electricity 
plans are communicated. The Australian Energy Market Commission‚Äôs 2018 Retail Energy 
Competition Review similarly finds consumers have reached record-low levels of trust in the 
industry.
In our previous work, BETA found re-designing electricity price fact sheets could increase 
consumer confidence when it comes to engaging in the electricity market. But a range of 
behavioural traits still contribute to consumer inertia: the time and effort needed to seek out, 
compare offers and choose a plan can seem like it‚Äôs just not worth the hassle; and many 
consumers fear something will go wrong if they switch. 
Electricity bills are a key way to inform consumers about their plan and usage, but bills are 
typically confusing and not useful to help consumers navigate the electricity market. Given all 
electricity consumers receive bills, the bill itself presents a useful vehicle to communicate the 
information consumers need to engage confidently in the electricity market. 
In partnership with the Department of the Environment and Energy, we drew on behavioural 
insights to design and test six electricity bills. We focussed on simplifying bill design to draw 
attention to key information, and including a ‚Äòways to save‚Äô box encouraging consumers to 
search for and switch to a better plan.
We tested electricity bills with around 4,200 Australians through an online survey experiment 
focussing on two key outcomes:
ÔÇ∑ confidence using the electricity bill to help look into finding a better plan; and 
ÔÇ∑ stated intention to look into options for switching plans in the next year.
We found simplified bills with ‚Äòways to save‚Äô information increased consumers‚Äô confidence by 
up to 13 per cent. But this did not translate into intention to look for a better offer.
Increasing consumer confidence in a market facing record-low levels of trust is important. For 
this reason alone, making bills clearer and more accessible for consumers makes sense and 
should be considered by electricity retailers.",,"Energy, Financial ",,,,,,,,,Electricity information to fit the bill: redesigning electricity bills to support consumer engagement | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,,,,,Consumer Protection,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Unsure,"4,200",The study found that simplified bills with 'ways to save' information increased consumers
BETA & Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC),password123: Applying behavioural insights to cyber security advice,2019,"The risks of poor cyber security intensify as more aspects of people‚Äôs lives and businesses 
become digitised and connected online. The methods cybercriminals use are more 
sophisticated than ever, meaning regular (non-expert) individuals and small businesses must 
also improve their ability to detect scams and protect their personal and business accounts 
and devices.
To help improve the impact of cyber security advice for individuals and small businesses, 
BETA partnered with the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) to design and test 
different formats of advice. We conducted focus groups and two survey experiments (surveys 
with embedded randomised controlled trials) to understand whether behavioural insights 
concepts are effective in shifting people‚Äôs intentions to enact safer cyber security practices. 
We surveyed small and medium business (SMB) owners and operators and tested the effect 
of different formats of advice. 
We developed plain text advice, a visually engaging infographic, and an ‚Äòinteractive‚Äô format 
which asked a quiz question and then ‚Äòrevealed‚Äô the correct answer in an infographic. We 
found seeing any type of cyber security advice strengthened SMB‚Äôs intentions to update 
software and back up data, by nine per cent and six per cent respectively, compared to those 
who saw no advice. The interactive advice also appeared to improve SMB‚Äôs accuracy in 
identifying phishing (fake) emails from genuine ones. However, in most cases plain text 
advice performed just as well as the same content presented in an infographic or interactive 
format. This suggests simple, jargon-free language may still be the most important aspect to 
consider in any advice. 
To better understand which approaches resonate most with individuals, we conducted four 
focus groups across metropolitan and regional areas in New South Wales (two groups) and 
Victoria (two groups). We asked participants to tell us about their reactions to different design 
concepts, as well as talk to their level of cyber security expertise and their experience of
cyber incidents.
Based on these findings, we designed advice using the messenger effect and tested the 
impact of our designs in an online survey experiment. We compared a ‚Äòpeer‚Äô messenger to 
an ‚Äòexpert‚Äô messenger (two senior government officials working in cyber security). We also 
tested whether participants responded more strongly to advice emphasising financial or nonfinancial costs of having poor cyber security. 
We found some evidence messengers may have a small positive impact on people‚Äôs 
intentions to update their software, but we only have moderate confidence in this finding. We 
also found no effect from messengers on people‚Äôs intentions to use strong and different 
passwords across important accounts, and no effect on either cyber security practice from 
using different financial or non-financial loss framing. Overall, our research suggests making 
cyber security advice salient and engaging can help make key messages stand out. 
However, simply providing advice alone is insufficient to change behaviour, and further 
research is needed to better understand which formats, framing, and channels are most 
impactful for different groups",,Cyber security,,,,,,,,,password123: Applying behavioural insights to cyber security advice | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,,,,,Cyber Security,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The study showed some statistically significant results.

BETA & DSS,Applying behavioural insights to online wagering,2020,"Online wagering is the fastest growing segment of gambling in Australia, and people who 
gamble online have been found to experience higher rates of gambling-related harm 
compared with other forms of gambling (Jenkinson et al. 2019). The Department of Social 
Services (DSS) commissioned BETA to design and evaluate easy-to-understand activity 
statements for online wagering consumers. Activity statements provide online wagering 
consumers with details of their gambling activities, including bets made, wins, losses and 
other account transactions over a specified time period. Drawing on principles from the 
National Consumer Protection Framework for Online Wagering - National Policy Statement 
(National Framework) and insights from behavioural science, BETA developed and tested
two activity statement prototypes. 
In a behavioural trial (experiment) using a purpose-built simulated gambling platform, we 
found showing participants an activity statement reduced the amount they bet when 
compared with participants who did not see a statement (by 7.6 per cent for Statement A and 
4.9 per cent for Statement B). This suggests providing online gamblers with regular, clear and 
useful information about their gambling can strengthen informed decision-making.
We focussed the design and content of the activity statements on correcting several 
behavioural biases known to affect gambling decisions. These relate to misperceptions about 
the randomness of events and probabilities (expecting a win after a series of losses), 
misperceptions about personal attributes and behaviours (beliefs about being a lucky person) 
and loss aversion (valuing losses more than gains). We found activity statements had a 
stronger effect for participants who held false gambling beliefs.
We also found viewing activity statements to have a stronger effect on the amount bet for 
moderate-risk gamblers, and those with lower financial literacy. A significant effect was also 
found for gamblers with loss-chasing tendencies. Taken together these findings suggest the 
activity statements are effective for groups at-risk of harm from gambling.
Participants completed a survey at the end of the simulated gambling platform to examine 
their views on the usefulness and ease-of-understanding of the prototypes. Comprehension 
was high, and participants overwhelmingly indicated a desire to receive activity statements 
from their online wagering service provider. Nearly all participants (91 per cent) said they 
would like to receive the statements in real life; many preferred this to be via email and every 
month.
The results from this project suggest activity statements have a significant role to play in 
reducing harm from gambling and providing online wagering consumers with meaningful and 
accessible information in order to make informed decisions about their gambling. The report 
sets out the recommended elements and style designs which have been found to achieve the 
objectives in the National Framework",,"Social, Health",,,,,,,,,Applying behavioural insights to online wagering | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,,,,,Gambling Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

BETA & ASIC,Slowing down to add it up: using behavioural insights to support decision-making about add-on insurance,2020,"Add-on insurance is insurance offered to consumers as an add-on when they buy a primary 
product (the main item consumers buy). Examples include travel insurance when buying a flight 
and extended warranties on items like phones, laptops, or whitegoods. Numerous reviews have 
found consumers often receive poor value for money, experience pressure to buy, and have 
low levels of understanding of and engagement with the add-on insurance market (Australian 
Securities and Investments Commission [ASIC], 2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2019; Productivity 
Commission, 2018; Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and 
Financial Services Industry, 2019; Treasury, 2019).
A number of behavioural biases and heuristics come into play when people consider insurance
generally, including loss, risk, and regret aversion. By tacking an offer onto the end of the 
primary purchase, the sales environment for add-on insurance heightens these and other
barriers such as sunk cost bias and anchoring to the price of the main product. These are 
further exacerbated during in-person sales, where the rapport a sales person builds during the 
consumer‚Äôs purchase of the primary product may make it harder for the consumer to say ‚Äòno‚Äô.
The Government has agreed to address these concerns through a deferred sales model, with 
ASIC to be given power to mandate the content of an information statement at the start of the 
deferral period. BETA partnered with ASIC to design and test an information statement to 
address some of these barriers and help consumers make more informed decisions by 
intervening in the sales process and providing an opt-out mechanism. In particular, the 
intervention sought to highlight the fact add-on insurance is not compulsory, prompt consumers 
to consider the value of the insurance and their personal circumstances, and encourage them 
to shop around. We also tested devices such as colour, icons, the government crest, and an 
Australian dollar coin to engage people in the content of the statement. We tested the effect of 
seeing an information statement, as well as variations of different statement designs, using a 
framed field experiment with a nationally representative sample of 6,243 people.
We found being given any information statement substantially decreased sales of add-on 
insurance in our experiment. Of people who were given an information statement, 29 per cent 
bought add-on insurance compared to 38 per cent of people who were not given an information 
statement. This is a 24 per cent reduction: a large and statistically significant difference. The 
impact was similar across all statement designs.
Our findings support the use of timely, clear, targeted and engaging prompts to better inform
consumers and help slow down the decision-making process. They also suggest the 
information statement gave people ‚Äòpermission‚Äô to turn down the offer by reminding them they 
weren‚Äôt legally required to buy add-on insurance. Looking ahead, research in real-world 
settings can help determine the long term impact of an information statement on demand for 
add-on insurance in Australia. Regardless of the final design, an information statement can act 
as an effective intervention to help create a buffer between the main sale and add-on sale, 
giving consumers space to make a decision",,Financial,,,,,,,,,https://behaviouraleconomics.pmc.gov.au/projects/slowing-down-add-it-using-behavioural-insights-support-decision-making-about-add-insurance,,,,,,,Consumer Protection,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Framed field experiment,6243,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

BETA & Australian Financial Security Authority,Clearer consequences: Helping people understand the outcomes of bankruptcy,2020,"For people in financial difficulties, applying for bankruptcy is a major life decision. Bankruptcy
releases people from most types of debt, giving them a fresh start. There are, however, 
additional consequences to applying for bankruptcy ‚Äì and deciding whether the benefits 
outweigh these consequences can be challenging. 
Applicants may experience cognitive overload due to new, complex and unfamiliar 
information ‚Äì making it harder to make the optimal decision. Some applicants may be overly 
optimistic in their ability to deal with bankruptcy consequences and fail to consider them in 
full, or they may simply not wish to engage with distressing information. 
The Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA) oversees personal insolvencies (including 
bankruptcy) in Australia. In 2020, AFSA streamlined the bankruptcy application process by 
moving it online, and worked to ensure applicants understand the consequences of going 
bankrupt before they apply.
BETA and AFSA worked together to develop several approaches to informing people about 
the consequences of bankruptcy, giving them the required information to make an 
appropriate decision for their circumstances. We ran two evaluation projects: 
1. Increasing understanding of the consequences of bankruptcy
Most bankruptcy applicants need to complete an educational tool (known as the 
‚Äòconsequences tool‚Äô) before they can apply for bankruptcy. In an online experiment with the 
general public, we tested six versions of the consequences tool. We measured people‚Äôs 
understanding of the consequences of bankruptcy by asking them a set of questions after 
they had completed one of the consequences tools.
People who did not see any consequences tool had a relatively low understanding of 
bankruptcy. They were able to correctly identify fewer than half of the consequences. The 
current consequences tool and the ‚ÄòPrescribed Information‚Äô (information presented to all 
applicants at the start of the bankruptcy application form) improved people‚Äôs understanding of 
the consequences. Two further educational tools, a video and a pop-up quiz, performed the 
best in improving people‚Äôs understanding and confidence.
2. Testing the impact of tailored and timely prompts within the application form
In a randomised controlled trial with bankruptcy applicants, we evaluated the effect of five 
prompts within the online bankruptcy application form. These prompts provided timely and 
tailored information on the consequences of bankruptcy. For the most part, including the 
prompts did not influence applicants‚Äô reporting behaviour (completion rate, value and count of 
assets, income declared), and did not have any unintended side-effects. 
The findings of these projects have broader implications for how the Government 
communicates with citizens. Across many services, the Government often needs to ensure 
people understand and apply complex information. This research contributes to our 
understanding of how this is best achieved",,Financial,,,,,,,,,Clearer consequences: Helping people understand the outcomes of bankruptcy | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,,,,,Financial Education,Full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,The description does not specify whether the study showed statistically significant results.

BETA & Australian Financial Security Authority,Introducing behavioural insights to the Personal Property Securities Register,2020,"The Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR) supports the growth of Australia‚Äôs economy. The 
PPSR makes it easy for businesses to safeguard their security interests (money owed to them or other 
obligations), helps them make informed purchasing decisions, and facilitates secured lending.
Businesses (and other entity types) register on the PPSR by completing an online form hosted by the 
Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA).
For a registration to be effective, businesses must provide details about themselves, the assets they 
are registering, and the other party in the transaction (known as the Grantor). Our previous research 
indicates some less frequent PPSR users get some of these details incorrect - in particular, details 
relating to the other party.
In response to BETA‚Äôs recommendations from our previous research (BETA 2020), AFSA 
implemented enhancements to the PPSR system, processes and supporting information. These 
enhancements focused on improving the experience for infrequent users. Two of these 
recommendations were evaluated using randomised controlled trials (RCTs):
1. A redesigned review screen
To prevent users from rushing through the registration process and to highlight the importance 
of registering correctly, we redesigned the review screen. A new pop-up alerted users that 
incorrectly completed registrations may not be valid. Users were also required to confirm 
details about themselves, details of what they were registering and details of the Grantor. We 
found these new additions to the review screen did not result in any improvement in the 
accuracy of registrations. 
2. New layout of the Grantor page and error-warning prompts
We introduced a more intuitive way of asking users to identify the Grantor. We also added five 
customised prompts that appeared when a mistake relating to a Grantor was made. These 
changes almost halved the number of incorrect transactions: 22.3% of PPSR transactions 
made by users who completed the business-as-usual registration form were incorrect, 
compared to only 12.8% of transactions made by those who saw the redesigned page. 
These evaluations shed light on ways government agencies can help less frequent users navigate 
complex registration processes. AFSA is planning to adopt the prompts as its business-as-usual 
practice, and is considering how to adopt the new Grantor page layout across the different user 
cohorts. Given the review screen did not decrease incorrect transactions, AFSA have opted to 
maintain their current review screen",,Financial,,,,,,,,,Introducing behavioural insights to the Personal Property Securities Register | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,,,,,Regulatory Compliance,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

BETA & Home Affairs,Stay smart: helping consumers choose cyber secure smart devices,2021,"Smart‚Äô devices are products with extra functionality to connect to the internet. Many smart 
devices lack basic cyber security features, and their rising popularity increases the risk of 
cyber security incidents and cybercrime. Consumers may not be aware of the risk of insecure 
smart devices, as it is currently difficult to find and use cyber security information when 
shopping for smart devices. As a result, manufacturers are not sufficiently incentivised to 
invest in cyber security.
A cyber security labelling scheme may help consumers make better purchasing
decisions. A label could communicate to consumers the overall level of cyber security of the 
device, or specific details such as for how long it will continue to receive security updates. 
This would allow consumers to compare products and make more cyber secure purchases.
In partnership with the Department of Home Affairs, BETA explored how cyber security labels 
could perform in an Australian setting. We designed three different cyber security labels:
a ‚Äògraded‚Äô label, using shield and tick icons to indicate four levels of cyber security; and two 
‚Äòexpiry‚Äô labels, indicating how long the device would receive guaranteed security updates 
(e.g. ‚Äúguaranteed until August 2023‚Äù). One expiry label included an icon, the other simply 
included the same information in plain text. 
We tested the labels in an online ‚Äòshopping scenario‚Äô with a nationally representative sample 
of 6,000 Australians. Participants were asked to choose which smart devices they would like 
to ‚Äòbuy‚Äô. We found:
‚Ä¢ Participants were more likely to choose a device with a cyber security label than one 
without a label, by 13-19 percentage points.
‚Ä¢ The graded shield had the largest impact, but the expiry labels were still effective.
‚Ä¢ A high security level or long expiry date increased the likelihood of choosing a device.
Follow-up questions and analysis allowed us to examine the different advantages and 
disadvantages of each label:
‚Ä¢ Participants preferred both the graded shield label and the icon expiry label over the 
plain text expiry label.
‚Ä¢ Participants generally had a better understanding of what the two expiry labels were 
communicating compared to the graded shield label. 
We expect in the real world people‚Äôs understanding of the labels would increase over time as 
they become familiar with them, and especially if supported by a consumer education 
campaign.
These results demonstrate the potential for a labelling scheme to improve consumer 
decision-making in the Australian smart device market. Further research in the field ‚Äì
such as partnering with a retailer and evaluating the impact of cyber security labels on real 
choices made by actual consumers ‚Äì could be considered to test how the current findings

BETA & Organ and Tissue Authority,Improving organ donor registration among young adults,2021,"The Organ and Tissue Authority (OTA) engaged the Behavioural Economics Team of the 
Australian Government (BETA) to learn more about how young adults (18-25 years) view 
organ donation, and to inform their annual DonateLife Week community awareness 
campaign. In particular, the OTA noted the large gap between the proportion of young adults 
who say they want to be organ donors and the proportion who have actually registered on the 
Australian Organ Donor Register. The act of registering is important as it provides a clear 
indication of wishes to family, and results in an increased likelihood that if a family is 
approached to consent to donation in the hospital, they will agree. In turn, this can help more 
people get a life-saving organ transplant.
The project involved 3 stages.
‚Ä¢ We conducted desktop research of organ donation and behavioural science 
literatures and developed draft messages for potential use by the OTA.
‚Ä¢ In May 2021, we ran four focus groups with 5-7 young adults per group, to learn 
about their views on organ donation, and to gather feedback on the draft messages.
‚Ä¢ Also in May, we conducted an online survey experiment and survey with 1,382 
respondents to gather views from a larger sample and to better understand which 
messages influence behaviour.
Many young adults want to be organ donors but just haven‚Äôt gotten around to it. That is, 
there is an intention-action gap when it comes to registering as an organ donor. One 
explanation for this is that young adults typically overestimate how difficult it will be to register
as an organ donor. (It is actually pretty easy.)
We used an online survey experiment to test 3 messages to assess whether they boosted 
registration intentions, as well as click throughs to the registration webpage and actual 
registrations. The most effective message highlighted how easy it is to register. It 
boosted intentions to register within the next week by 7-8 percentage points compared to the 
alternatives messages (29% of respondents versus 21-22%). However, in a separate survey 
question, respondents preferred other messages. Nonetheless, we consider the experimental 
evidence on intentions to register as stronger evidence than stated preferences. 
People are more likely to register if there are more opportunities to do so. Young adults 
would welcome opportunities to register as part of other government processes. Ideally, such 
processes would be in some way related to organ donation. Utilising Medicare interactions 
presents a compelling option (with 72% of respondents responding positively). Other popular 
options included the myGov platform (55%), and driver‚Äôs licences (54%).

BETA & Treasury,YourSuper Comparison Tool: Results from a survey and two survey experiments,2021,"Why we undertook this project
Many Australians have invested their savings in superannuation funds that significantly underperform benchmark net returns. This is typically due to a combination of weak returns and high fees. Ultimately, underperformance can lead to retirement savings that are far lower than they might have been. 
The YourSuper Comparison Tool website (‚Äòthe comparison tool‚Äô) was developed to empower superannuation fund members. The comparison tool allows people to compare the performance and fees of MySuper products, with the aim of making it easier for them to choose a well performing product that meets their needs.  
What we did
The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) led the design and development of the comparison tool, in collaboration with a multi-agency team comprising staff from the Treasury, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), and the Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government (BETA). 
BETA and the ATO‚Äôs Behavioural Insights Unit worked together to contribute behavioural insights to the design process. This included running a survey and 2 survey experiments to generate relevant evidence. The survey, completed by 2,236 eligible respondents in January 2021, included questions on: when respondents would be likely to use the comparison tool, the best way to describe a poor performer, and, in which format they would prefer an ‚Äòunderperformance notice‚Äô (mail or email). 
Results and limitations
In the first survey experiment, we tested how super products were classified and sorted on the results page of the comparison tool. They were either placed into 2 categories (‚Äòpoor‚Äô or ‚Äògood‚Äô performance) or 3 categories (‚Äòpoor‚Äô, ‚Äòfair‚Äô, or ‚Äòtop‚Äô performance). As we expected, respondents who saw the additional ‚Äòtop‚Äô performance category were better at selecting one of the best performing funds than those who saw only 2 performance categories.  
In the second experiment, we tested different ways to communicate the risk/return trade off associated with different super products. For example we tested accurate but technical language (such as ‚Äòlow risk and low expected return‚Äô) against terms that are common in the super industry but where the risk level is implied (such as ‚Äòconservative‚Äô, ‚Äòbalanced‚Äô and ‚Äògrowth‚Äô). Respondents who were presented with common industry terms for risk/return were better at selecting the optimal option in the scenario presented.
Our overall judgement is that these results are likely to reflect how people would respond to these design options in the real world. Some caution is warranted since survey experiments only test responses in an artificial setting. Furthermore, online survey panels are not fully representative of the general population. However, we collected a large and diverse sample of superannuation members, and we designed an experiment that sought to mimic real world decision making. 
This research was considered in the development of the YourSuper comparison tool alongside user research conducted by the ATO and consultation with the super fund industry and other stakeholders.

BETA & ACCC,Increasing transparency of online foreign exchange calculators,2023,"Every year, Australians transfer an estimated $21 billion to family and friends overseas, 
making use of international money transfer (IMT) services (ACCC 2019). However, IMT 
pricing is complex and often not transparent for consumers. To assist businesses supplying 
IMT services, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission issued best practice 
guidance, aimed at improving how IMT offers are presented to consumers. As a result, 
businesses now provide IMT calculators to allow consumers to better understand the 
costs associated with the transaction, and ultimately get better value for their transfer.
However, while IMT calculators can help, there is still room for improvement. Calculators 
differ from provider to provider, which means that comparing offers across different 
calculators is challenging. In particular, when a calculator adds fees (rather than subtracting 
them) it is harder to compare offers; no-fee transfers can ‚Äòhide‚Äô the cost of the transaction in a 
high foreign exchange rate (FX) margin; and the total cost of the transaction to the customer 
is often hard to determine directly. 
BETA worked with the ACCC to design and test changes to online IMT calculators that 
could help consumers choose better value offers. We first designed seven new 
calculators to address the three key problems outlined above. We then ran online survey 
experiments with 5,673 Australians to test which type of calculator best helped consumers 
choose the best value offer. We found: 
Consistently subtracting fees made it easy to compare offers and choose the best 
deal. When fees are consistently subtracted, the cost to the customer remains the same 
across providers and people can therefore rely on the amount received by the recipient ‚Äì a 
common heuristic ‚Äì to accurately guide them to the highest value offer. Consistently 
subtracting fees also made people more confident in their choices.
Providing ‚Äòcomparison rate prompts‚Äô also improved people‚Äôs ability to choose the best 
deal. These prompts summarised the total cost of the transaction as a dollar value or per 
cent. Further, the prompts were also the most impactful when people were asked to judge the 
value from a single calculator (without a comparison). We found no evidence of ‚Äòcognitive 
overload‚Äô or other downsides when combining elements in a single calculator; e.g. adding 
prompts, FX margins, and consistently subtracting fees.
Based on these findings, subtracting fees and adding a comparison prompt would result in 
the highest performance both when consumers are considering a single offer, and when they 
are comparing offers. These results demonstrate the potential for improvements to IMT 
calculators further helping consumers choose the best deal when making international 
money transfers. Further research in the field ‚Äì such as partnering with an IMT provider and 
evaluating the impact of calculators on real choices made by actual consumers ‚Äì could be 
considered to test how the current findings translate to a real-world context",,"Financial, Currency exchange",,,,,,,,,Increasing transparency of online foreign exchange calculators | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,,,,,Consumer Protection,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Regular RCT,5673,The study found that consistently subtracting fees and providing comparison rate prompts improved consumers
BETA & APSC,Increasing disability identification in the Australian Public Service,2023,"All government agencies collect employee data, including disability status, in human resource 
(HR) information systems for the Australian Public Service Employment Database (APSED). 
At June 2023, half as many people have shared they have a disability in HR systems 
(5.1%) compared to those who have shared the same information in the de-identified 
Australian Public Service Employee Census (10.9%; APSC 2023a).
Attitudinal, organisational and structural barriers prevent some employees from sharing their 
information in HR systems. Workplace culture, policies and practices influence employee 
comfort in sharing information. Moreover, some staff choose not to share information 
because they do not see a benefit to doing so or hold concerns about negative career 
impacts. Explaining the purpose of sharing information and the protections in place can help 
reduce ambiguity and overcome these barriers. Our research focuses on how agencies 
communicate about disability data collection and use. 
Across 2 projects, we applied behavioural science to help inform APS employees about 
disability data collection: 
Part 1: In consultation with APS employees with disability and HR professionals, 
BETA developed guidance materials for APS HR professionals to support their 
communication with employees about data collection and use. 
Insights: Clear and complete information about data collection and use to 
employees reduces uncertainty, while preserving employees‚Äô autonomy to decide 
what is right for themselves. For example, practical information about the privacy and 
confidentiality of HR data can help reduce concerns. 
Part 2: BETA designed and tested 4 different reminder emails encouraging APS 
employees in a large agency to update their diversity details in their agency HR 
systems. 
Insights: An email to employees highlighting the ease of updating disability 
information in their agency HR system resulted in more people sharing their 
information. Email reminders are a low-cost and practical way to encourage 
employees to update their diversity details in HR systems. Our trial shows that small 
changes in email reminders can significantly impact behaviour.",,HR,,,,,,,,,Increasing disabilit...~https://behaviouraleconomics.pmc.gov.au/projects/increasing-disability-identification-australian-public-service,,,,,,,Disability Inclusion,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,The sample size is not given.,The description does not provide specific information on whether the study showed statistically significant results
BETA & Department of Energy,Energy labels that make cents: A randomised controlled trial to test the effect of appliance energy rating labels,2017,"In 2015, Australian households contributed 11.1 per cent of Australia‚Äôs carbon 
emissions (Commonwealth of Australia, 2017), with about 45 per cent of these 
carbon emissions accounted for by household appliances and equipment (Reidy and 
Milne, 2017). Lower efficiency appliances contribute greater emissions and cost 
consumers more to run. 
To encourage production of more energy efficient appliances and assist consumers 
to make more informed choices, the Australian Government requires an Energy 
Rating Label on appliances sold in stores. This requirement does not extend to 
appliances sold online. 
Energy labels can provide important information on energy consumption and running 
costs, which consumers may otherwise be unaware of when making decisions about 
which appliances to buy. Absence of this information could lead them to undervalue 
more efficient appliances. Higher energy efficient appliances often cost more 
up-front, but over time can lower household energy bills and reduce overall 
emissions. The Energy Rating Label aims to help consumers compare the energy 
efficiency of similar appliances by providing information on average annual energy 
use in kilowatt-hours (kWh) and assigning a star rating to each appliance. 
In partnership with the Department of the Environment and Energy (DoEE) and 
Appliances Online we conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the 
impact of energy labels on decisions made by Australian consumers shopping for 
appliances in an online environment. We assessed the impact of the Energy Rating 
Label and we used behavioural insights to design and test an alternative label. 
Growing evidence from behavioural economics shows most people have difficulty 
making decisions when they have to weigh immediate costs against future benefits 
accruing slowly over time, and comparing multiple options with multiple attributes. To 
address this, we designed a simple, more salient label to inform consumers of how 
much money they could avoid losing by buying a more efficient appliance compared 
to the lowest rated, one-star appliance of the same size and capacity. 
Information on the alternative label was expressed in simple dollar terms rather than 
the more abstract kWh metric. We expected this form of labelling would make 
consumers more aware of hip-pocket costs ‚Äì for example, a person buying a 
four-star top mount fridge could avoid losing $1,700 in lifetime running costs

BETA & ATO,Making it less taxing - better compliance with deferred GST,2017,"The Australian Taxation Office is the Australian Government‚Äôs principal revenue 
collection agency and administers Australia‚Äôs tax system and significant aspects of 
Australia‚Äôs superannuation system. It administers legislation governing tax, 
superannuation and the Australian Business Register and supports the delivery of 
government benefits to the community. Improving tax compliance is a major policy 
goal as non-compliance can reduce the overall tax base, increase the costs of 
administration and lead to an uneven playing field for businesses doing the right 
thing. 
As part of the legislation the Deferred Goods and Services Tax (DGST) Scheme 
allows businesses to defer the payment of GST on taxable importations into 
Australia. This helps businesses manage their cash flow. Cash flow is important for 
businesses because it helps them meet everyday business needs and avoid taking 
on more debt. This means there is a strong driver for businesses to be on the 
Scheme. Participation in the Scheme allows 13,000 businesses to defer payment of 
$26 billion in GST annually.
To be on the Scheme, businesses must comply with requirements including digital 
lodgment of monthly activity statements and being up to date on all lodgments and 
payments due to the ATO. At any one time about one in three businesses do not 
comply. The ATO can revoke access to the Scheme if a business does not fully 
comply, which negatively affects cash flow and means the business will need to 
reapply to be reinstated. 
BETA partnered with the ATO to test behaviourally informed methods of 
communication (variations on emails) aimed at improving compliance among 
businesses in the Scheme. We ran two separate randomised controlled trials to test 
the effectiveness of these emails. 
The first trial evaluated the impact of sending a ‚Äòcooperative‚Äô or ‚Äòdirect‚Äô toned 
reminder email to existing businesses who were found to be non-compliant with the 
Scheme. The aim was to encourage self-compliance, educate businesses on their
tax obligations and reduce recurrent non-compliance. Both emails improved 
compliance rates but variations in the tone of the reminders did not affect the 
compliance rate.

The second trial tested the effectiveness of sending a welcome email to new 
businesses who had just registered on the Scheme. The aim of the email was to

BETA & ATO,Improving tax compliance: deductions for work related expenses in income tax returns filed through tax agents,2017,"In the Australian Income Tax system, individual taxpayers are entitled to claim deductions for expenses 
incurred while earning salary and wage income. These deductions are called work related expenses. 
According to Taxation Statistics, work related expense deductions grew by 15 per cent from 2010-11 to 
2015 16. In 2015-16, 8.6 million taxpayers claimed nearly $22 billion in work related expense deductions. 
There is evidence that claims for work-related expense deductions can be erroneous and there is a 
propensity to over claim, including in returns prepared by tax agents. In his National Press Club address on 
5 July 2017, the Commissioner of Taxation expressed concern about the accuracy of work-related expense 
claims related to work, clothing and vehicles in the 2014-15 financial year. While individual amounts overclaimed can be small, the sum and overall revenue impact is significant. The Commissioner estimated the 
overall revenue impact was in the vicinity of $2.5 billion. 
Research by H&R Block in 2016 indicated one in five taxpayers believed misrepresentation of tax return 
information isn‚Äôt so bad, and 71 per cent believed they could claim something they were not entitled to 
(Lonergan Research 2016). PhD research (Wurth 2013) found tax agents rated their clients‚Äô work-related 
expense claims as the ‚Äòleast compliant‚Äô label on the tax return. Behavioural insights offers a low-cost tool to 
address these behaviours and underlying attitudes and help taxpayers willingly comply with the tax system. 
The Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government (BETA) partnered with the Australian 
Taxation Office (ATO) to examine the extent to which behaviourally-informed communications to tax agents 
could reduce erroneous work related expense claims. In particular, we tested the effectiveness of a letter 
sent to tax agents drawing on behavioural insights to address social norms.
We used a randomised controlled trial to test the impact of sending this letter to tax agents whose clients 
had higher than expected work-related expense claims compared to their peers. The letter specifically 
identified each agent‚Äôs clients who had lodged higher than expected claims (referred to as ‚Äòidentified 
clients‚Äô). There were over 2,000 tax agents in the trial, who were randomly assigned to a letter group or a 
‚Äòno letter‚Äô control group.
17 per cent of agents in the letter group lodged amendments, compared with 1 per cent of agents in the ‚Äòno 
letter‚Äô group. On average, identified clients represented by agents in the letter group reduced their work 
related expense claims by $191, compared with a $2 increase in the ‚Äòno letter‚Äô group. Overall, identified 
clients reduced their work-related expense claims by a total of $2.2 million. If we had sent the letter to all 
agents in the trial, including those who did not receive a letter, we expect this simple messaging 
intervention would have decreased work related expense deductions by about $4.4 million.
The letter led to an increase in the average total tax paid per client of $76, for a total of $0.9 million. If we 
had sent the letter to all agents in the trial, total tax revenue would have increased by an estimated $1.7 
million. We cannot be sure about the contribution of the reduction in work-related expense claims to the 
increase in tax paid, because amendments to tax return labels other than work-related expenses could 
have influenced the net tax position. 
Overall, these findings indicate low-cost, well-targeted and well-designed communications incorporating 
behavioural insights are effective in reducing erroneous work-related expense claims although the length of 
time for which this behavioural change is sustained remains unknown",,Tax,,,,,,,,,Improving tax compliance: deductions for work related expenses in income tax returns filed through tax agents | Behavioural Economics (pmc.gov.au),,,Original database,Aug-18,,,Tax Compliance,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,"Over 2,000 tax agents.",The study showed statistically significant results.

"BETA, Treasury & Westpac",Credit when it's due: Reducing credit card debt,2017,"People who make only the minimum repayment on their credit 
card could be paying hundreds of dollars a year in high 
interest payments. SMS reminders are an effective tool to 
encourage people to repay more and save money.
Credit cards give people flexibility, allowing them to make short-term payments they may 
otherwise have to forgo or delay. Repaying the balance as soon as possible means avoiding 
high interest charges. Despite such a strong financial incentive, many people consistently 
repay only the minimum amount‚Äîcosting them potentially hundreds of dollars more a year. 
While many people often simply cannot afford to pay more than the minimum, evidence 
suggests many others repay only the minimum due to one or more behavioural biases such 
as status quo bias, present bias, optimism bias, or anchoring. To help, we designed a 
behaviourally informed intervention to see whether we could encourage consumers to pay 
earlier and save money. 
To test this, we worked with Westpac and the Treasury to design reminder messages, 
encouraging consumers who consistently pay only the minimum, to repay more. We 
incorporated words and phrases designed to make the benefits of repaying credit card 
balances as soon as possible more salient. We then evaluated the effect of these messages 
using a randomised controlled trial.
SMS reminders had an immediate impact on consumer repayment behaviour, resulting in a 
$134 (28 per cent) increase in repayments and close to a one percentage point increase in 
balance paid in the following month, compared to consumers who received no message. We 
also found a long-term effect on the balance owed. Consumers who received an SMS 
reminder had, on average, smaller balances twelve months later. By contrast, there was no 
such effect from sending email reminders.
The specific content or wording used in the SMS did not seem to matter. Consumers who 
received any type of SMS reminder increased repayments. Repetition also appeared to have 
little impact. Sending reminders again in subsequent months did not have the same impact 
as the initial message.
Our research suggests sending an SMS reminder to consumers before their payment due 
date can encourage them to make higher repayments. Further research into the message 
content, timing, and frequency is warranted. In any case, SMS reminders are a simple, costeffective tool to support consumer decision-making and improve financial wellbeing in the

BETA & Fair Work Ombudsman,Building Persistent Compliance with Labour Law: Evidence from a Randomised Controlled Trial,2017,"All employees working in Australia are entitled to a minimum wage and 
standards of employment. The underpayment of wages and 
entitlements is a serious social and economic issue affecting workers, 
businesses and the community.
Drawing on BETA‚Äôs insights from behavioural science and the Fair Work Ombudsman‚Äôs (FWO) experience, 
we partnered to test the impact of audits on around 2,000 small businesses, and to see if small changes to 
the audit processes could lead to better outcomes for workers, businesses and the community.
Small business owners can feel overwhelmed by competing priorities. Our aim in redesigning audit 
processes was to support employers to understand and meet their obligations. To help improve compliance 
further, we simplified communications, drawing on behaviourally informed techniques such as planning 
prompts, and added a reminder of the annual wage increase. We tested whether this would lead to higher 
levels of ongoing compliance a year after the audit was undertaken.
We found the FWO‚Äôs standard audits improve ongoing rates of compliance with award wage rates. 
Furthermore, the behaviourally informed changes we made to the audit communications and process 
(including timely reminders) reduced non-compliance with monetary entitlements by a further 24 per cent
(14.6 per cent compared with 19.3 per cent for the standard audit). We estimate this led to employees 
being $900 per person better off annually, as compared to the standard audit. This was driven by 
improvements in ongoing compliance. In total, the three audit variations helped prevent underpayments for 
around 200 employees, representing a drop of about 30 per cent in the number of underpaid employees. 
In addition, we found businesses rated the 
behaviourally informed audit significantly more helpful 
and informative; as well as less confronting, complex, 
and confusing. The audits were also faster for 
employers to complete and to supply records, 
taking 15 days compared with 23 days for the 
standard audit.
These small changes are cost-effective and 
easily scalable, both across the FWO‚Äôs audits 
and other services and resources delivered by 
the FWO. Insights gained from this trial are 
useful for the FWO and other organisations

BETA & Australian Cyber Security Centre,On the alert: Using behavioural insights to boost the impact of cyber security alerts,2020,"We partnered with the Australian Signals Directorate‚Äôs (ASD) Australian Cyber Security 
Centre (ACSC) to find ways of boosting the impact of an email alert system. The ACSC alert 
service alert system (the ‚Äòalert service‚Äô) is a free email subscription service available to the 
public. An alert is sent to subscribers whenever an emerging cyber security trend or threat 
becomes apparent. The alerts outline what people should look for, how to avoid or prevent 
the incident from happening to them, and what to do if someone may have been impacted. 
The alert service has been running since 2010 and had over 57,000 subscribers as of August 
2020.
Despite the large reach of the alert system, email can be a difficult platform to spread 
awareness compared with other, more visible channels such as SMS or social media. We 
applied behavioural insights to the email design to bolster its effects, and tested these
different design aspects using a randomised controlled trial. Our email trial was launched in 
February 2020, and used the top performing alerts of 2019 as the basis for the alert content. 
Subscribers were randomly assigned to receive an alert with one or more of our new design 
features (or a business-as-usual alert with the standard branding). Everyone received the 
same email content.
We trialled two new behaviourally informed design features: salient icons at the top of the 
page designed to give readers information about the urgency or action required at a glance, 
and a banner calling upon users to share the alert with their contacts.
We found including icons increased email open rates and interaction with the alert, and 
encouraging subscribers to share the alert with others increased forwarding rates. Without 
the icons, 2.9 per cent of subscribers interacted with the email by clicking on embedded links. 
This increased to 3.6 per cent for the best performing icon. Of those whose email did not 
include a sharing banner, 0.3 per cent shared the email by forwarding it or through social 
media. This more than doubled to 0.8 per cent of those whose email did include a banner. 
Small improvements to emails can make a big difference when applied to the alert service 
database with over 57,000 subscribers. For example, adding an action icon to a business-asusual alert could result in over 940 more readers opening the email. Including a sharing 
banner could result in around 320 more people sharing each alert with friends, family, and 
colleagues. Including a timing icon could result in an extra 360 people saving or printing a
copy of the alert. Icons and banners are low-cost, low-effort ways to improve the spread and

"BETA, DSS & PMC",Increasing workplace giving,2018,"Behaviourally informed emails from a senior manager and 
easier sign-up can increase charitable workplace giving. 
Planned giving, including workplace giving through payroll, is important to charities and 
not-for-profit organisations as it provides a regular source of income. Although more 
Australian employers are offering workplace giving, employee participation is usually low. 
On behalf of the Prime Minister‚Äôs Community Business Partnership and in collaboration with 
the Department of Social Services (DSS), BETA tested ways to increase workplace giving 
across three separate behavioural trials, in two Australian Public Service (APS) departments
and with one corporate partner. The trials were conducted between 2018 ‚Äì 2021. 
For trial one, we applied behavioural insights to the design of an email from a senior manager 
in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) and tested the impact through a 
randomised controlled trial (RCT). At another PM&C site, we conducted a before/after 
comparison of the email in combination with a small gift. We found the behaviourally informed 
email increased workplace giving participation from 2.0% to 3.3%. Behaviourally informed 
emails outperformed basic information emails. The gift in combination with the email 
increased workplace giving but was not more effective than the behaviourally informed email 
alone.
For trial two, we built on these results in DSS. We tested variations of the behaviourally 
informed email with two different messengers (emails from a senior manager and a peer 
messenger), alongside an easier sign-up process. The best-performing intervention came 
from a senior manager, combined with the simpler sign-up process. This resulted in a 
workplace giving rate of 3.8%, compared with 1.4% for an email from a peer messenger 
using the existing sign-up process. 
For trial three, we tested a behaviourally informed email in a corporate setting using an RCT. 
We tested whether asking people to ‚Äògive later‚Äô, with a time delay between committing to give 
and monetary donations, would result in higher workplace giving sign-ups than asking people 
to ‚Äògive now‚Äô. The overall sign-up rate was very low, possibly due to environmental factors
relating to COVID-19. No significant differences were found between the two groups. 
Our studies in two APS departments show sending employees emails with information about 
their workplace giving program can increase participation. Behaviourally informed emails
from a senior manager can have an even bigger impact. Testing in different organisational 
settings is important as we found the behaviourally informed emails did not increase 
workplace giving sign-ups in a corporate environment. Making the sign-up process as easy 
as possible is important and alternative mediums to email should be considered if email 
communication is already heavily relied upon in the workplace. Applying these small, low-cost 
changes can increase charitable workplace giving.",,Philanthropy,,,,,,,,,Increasing workplace...~https://behaviouraleconomics.pmc.gov.au/projects/increasing-workplace-giving,,,Original database,Mar-22,,,Charitable Giving,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

BETA & DSS,Workplace giving at corporate partner,2022,"Planned giving is an important source of income for the 
not-for-profit sector. While more employers are offering 
workplace giving programs, participation is low.
Planned giving is important for the not for profit sector as it can provide them with a reliable 
source of income, helping them plan their activities. Planned giving is also financially 
beneficial for charities, reducing processing costs by receiving lump sum payments, providing 
access to new donors and decreasing the need for expensive fundraisers.
Research on giving trends in Australia found respondents who planned their donations 
reported giving six times more than those who identified as spontaneous givers (McGregorLowndes et al, 2017). Planned giving can include once-off donations like bequests, and 
regular payments such as workplace giving.
Workplace giving allows employees to donate some of their pre-tax salary to charity directly 
through payroll at work. The employee can benefit from an immediate tax deduction without 
the need to keep receipts and the convenience of automatic donations. 
In recent years, workplace giving represented around one per cent of total gifts or donations 
(ATO, 2019a). The amount donated through workplace giving in Australia increased from 
$23 million in 2009-10 to $43 million in 2018-19 (Workplace Giving Australia, 2020). 
The total number of employers in Australia offering workplace giving programs has increased 
from 2,809 in 2009-10 to 5,382 in 2018-19, with 33% of working Australians having access
(Workplace Giving Australia, 2020). But the proportion of employees enrolled in these 
programs remained at around 5% over this period, leaving room for improvement (Workplace 
Giving Australia, 2020). If 10% of working Australians donated $5 a week through workplace 
giving, an additional $338 million would be available to the community each year1. 
Different organisational factors, such as governance structures, salary and perceptions of
corporate social responsibility can impact giving behaviour (Shaker & Christensen, 2019). 
Workplace giving is known to vary significantly by industry (Osili et al. 2011) and organisation 
size (Haski-Leventhal, 2013). 
Past research has found employees of for-profit organisations gave at higher rates than the 
public sector (Witty & Urla, 1989; Haski-Leventhal, 2013). Of the private sector organisations 
in Australia offering workplace giving, the most up-to-date publically available data shows 
5.9% of employees participate (ATO, 2016). Of the APS agencies offering workplace giving, 
1.8% of employees participate, each donating on average around $375 per annum over the 
year in 2017-18 (ATO, 2019b).",,Philanthropy,,,,,,,,,,,,Original database,Mar-22,,,Philanthropy Policy,This is a full study with results.,Something else,Unsure,The sample size is not given.,The description does not provide information on whether the study showed statistically significant results.
BETA & ABS,Counting on us: How start dates affect Census participation,2019,"The Census of Population and Housing (the Census) is the most comprehensive data 
collection exercise in Australia, involving around 10 million households and over 25 million 
people. Conducted every five years by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the Census 
provides valuable information on the social, economic and cultural characteristics of all 
Australians. 
Historically, the ABS directed people to complete the Census on a specific evening known as
‚ÄòCensus night‚Äô. To make it easier for people to engage with the 2021 Census, ABS advised 
people they now have a number of days ‚Äì or a ‚Äòresponse window‚Äô ‚Äì to complete the Census. 
Prior to making this change, ABS partnered with BETA to redesign the Census letter and test
two ways of presenting the response window to the public. The first version of the letter
included a response window of one week (‚Äúcomplete between 11 and 17 October‚Äù). The 
second version had an immediate response window (‚Äúcomplete between now and 17 
October‚Äù).
The ABS runs a number of Census Tests to refine processes ahead of the actual Census.
We used one of these Census Tests to run a randomised controlled trial to measure the 
impact of the two response windows. This Census Test took place in Wagga Wagga (NSW) 
and Logan (QLD) in October 2019. More than 26,000 households were randomly selected to
receive a letter with a ‚Äòcomplete now‚Äô or a ‚Äòcomplete between‚Äô response window. 
The proportion of households commencing and completing the Census Test was similar
regardless of which response window they saw. There was, however, a difference in when 
households commenced and completed their survey. Those who received the ‚Äôcomplete now‚Äô 
letter were more likely to commence the Census Test sooner. Those who received the 
‚Äôcomplete between‚Äô window were more likely to respond on, or just after, the Census Test
night. The ‚Äòcomplete now‚Äô variation effectively spread responses out over a longer period, 
reducing the administrative burden associated with collecting many responses on a single 
day. In particular, there were 26% fewer lodgements on Census Test night compared to the
‚Äòcomplete between‚Äô group. 
This research provides evidence that subtle wording changes to letters can impact the 
dynamics of survey commencement and completion by recipients. These findings contributed 
to ABS‚Äô decision to adopt the ‚Äòcomplete now‚Äô framing in the 2021 Census. 
In the 2021 Census, more people chose to complete the form earlier. Almost two thirds (63%) 
of households completed their form on or before Census day, compared to 45% in 2016. The 
overall response rate of the 2021 Census improved from 95.1% in 2016 to 96.1% in 2021. 
However, because ABS introduced a host of other public engagement initiatives ahead of the
2021 Census, we cannot attribute a single measure as the cause of the improved completion

economically and politically. The Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) provides free 
English language tuition to migrants with less than a vocational level of English1. Not all 
migrants who are eligible for the AMEP currently enrol in it and those that do often disengage
before exhausting their eligibility.
BETA partnered with the Department of Home Affairs to conduct two trials to increase 
participation in the AMEP. We tested whether sending people translated information about 
the program would increase participation above the current practice of providing information 
in English. 
In the first trial we tested a letter and email in English and a letter and email in participants‚Äô 
home languages. We sent this material to 16,990 people with eligible visas who arrived in 
Australia between 1 July 2017 and 31 December 2020 who had not previously enrolled in the 
AMEP. 
In the second trial, we tested a text message in either English or in the participants‚Äô home 
languages coming from either Home Affairs or their former AMEP provider. We sent the 
message to 26,113 AMEP students who had disengaged between 1 July 2017 and 
30 September 2021. 
Across the two trials 985 participants (re-)engaged with the AMEP. We found no difference in 
engagement with the AMEP between the groups who received the communication material in 
English and those who received it in their home languages across both trials. We also found 
no difference in engagement between those who received the text message from 
Home Affairs and those who received it from their provider.
We embedded links to the AMEP website in the emails and text messages. We found that 
people who received the translated text message were significantly more likely to click the 
link than those who received the English text message. Similarly, participants who received 
the text message from Home Affairs were more likely to click the link than those who received
the message from their former AMEP provider.
The two trials suggest short, electronic communication to migrants about enrolling in the 
AMEP can be sent in English. However, for longer documents, hard-copy documents and 
documents that require deeper processing and analytical thinking, we recommend translating 
them into people‚Äôs home languages to ensure they are fully understood. Similarly, if the aim

Sustainability Victoria,Victorian Healthy Homes Trial,2022,"The Victorian Healthy Homes Program was a randomised controlled trial designed to measure the 
impact of an energy efficiency and thermal comfort home upgrade on temperature, energy use, health
and quality of life. Analysis indicated that a relatively minor upgrade (average $2,809) had wideranging benefits over the winter period. Average indoor temperature was increased by 0.33oC, with 
increases particularly strong in the morning, when temperatures are lowest. Exposure to cold 
temperatures (<18oC) was reduced by 43 minutes per day. Subjective experience of warmth is 
important; it does not always match temperature measurements. Householders in the intervention 
group were more than twice as likely as controls to report that their home felt warmer over winter. 
These gains in thermal comfort were obtained despite a significant reduction in gas use in upgraded 
homes, and no change in electricity use. There was no evidence of a rebound effect, with intervention 
participants less likely than controls to use their main heater and less likely to resort to other options 
to stay warm. Householders in the intervention group reported less condensation over winter. 
Importantly, the upgrade was associated with benefits in health, with reduced breathlessness, and 
improved quality of life, particularly its mental health and social care aspects. Health benefits of the 
upgrade were reflected in cost savings, with $887 per person saved in the healthcare system over the 
winter period. Cost-benefit analysis indicated that the upgrade would be cost-saving within 3 years ‚Äì

DEWR,Online Employment Services Trial (OEST) Evaluation,2020,"About the Online Employment Services Trial
The Online Employment Services Trial (OEST) sought to test whether job seekers with Mutual 
Obligation Requirements (MORs) receiving employment services assistance through jobactive could 
effectively self-manage using an online platform. This included undertaking job search and meeting 
their MORs.
The OEST was offered for a maximum of six months to job seekers who were considered the most 
job-ready and who did not require any specialised assistance. Participants agreed to an online Job 
Plan designed to help them meet their MORs and accessed the jobactive website to search for jobs 
and report their job search efforts online.
Unlike those in provider-based servicing, OEST participants were not matched with an employment 
service provider; nor were they required to attend appointments. However, participants could opt 
out of OEST and transfer to jobactive provider-based services at any time by contacting the National 
Customer Service Line (NCSL) of the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (the 
department). Participants who had not left the service within six months were transferred from the 
OEST to provider-based services.
Key findings
Efficiency
‚Ä¢ OEST participants commenced services more quickly than the comparison group.
Sixty-two per cent of OEST participants commenced employment services on the day they were 
referred, compared to 10% of the comparison group.
‚Ä¢ Fewer than one in 10 OEST participants (9.3%) opted out of the OEST, either before or after 
commencement in the trial, with 3.8% opting out before commencement and 5.5% opting out 
after commencement. The main reasons job seekers expressed for opting out of the trial after 
commencement were a preference for face-to-face servicing (49%) and a lack of confidence in, 
or difficulty with, using computers or the internet (12%).
‚Ä¢ Opt-out rates were notably higher for participants aged 50 years or older, both prior to 
commencement (12%) and after commencement (9.8%). Participants without Year 12 and those 
living in outer regional areas also had higher opt-out rates.

‚Ä¢ The majority of OEST participants were satisfied with the jobactive website (80%) and found the 
website functionality easy to use (83%).
‚Ä¢ OEST participants were as likely to incur no job search related demerit points as those in 
provider servicing.
Effectiveness
‚Ä¢ OEST participants in the quantitative research indicated higher levels of confidence than did 
those in the comparison group that the assistance they received would help them secure 
employment.
‚Ä¢ Over two-thirds of OEST participants in a longitudinal survey agreed that their skills in using the 
internet for job searches and applications had increased (70%) together with their job-seeking 
skills (68%).
‚Ä¢ OEST participants were more likely to report that their employment services were improving 
their chances of getting a job than the comparison group (63% versus 46%).
‚Ä¢ OEST participants were as likely to exit income support and employment services within 
six months of commencement as those receiving provider-based services (50% versus 52% and 
47% versus 47% respectively). This suggested that job-ready job seekers in online servicing can 
achieve similar employment outcomes to comparable job seekers in provider servicing. Given 
online servicing was provided at a lower cost than provider-based services, it was a more costeffective way of providing employment services to job-ready job seekers.
‚Ä¢ When exits within one month (four weeks) and three months (12 weeks) of service 
commencement were considered, OEST participants performed better than the comparison 
group.
‚Ä¢ However, OEST participants had poorer results than comparison job seekers after they 
transferred to provider servicing. After a nine-month period (including three months in provider 
servicing and a full six months in the OEST) trial participants were less likely to exit from income 
support and employment services (5.3% and 2.7% less respectively) than the comparison group. 
Potential explanations include participants finding the adjustment of transferring from OEST to 
provider servicing challenging, and a lack of financial incentives for jobactive providers to service 
Stream A entrants to their caseloads during the first 90 days (including former OEST
Online Employment Services Trial Evaluation| 18
participants).
2
It is also possible that provider servicing from the outset was more suitable for 
this cohort, perhaps due to undisclosed disadvantage or a lack of ability to self-manage their job 
search requirements.
‚Ä¢ Online servicing was as successful as provider servicing at maintaining exits from income 
support. Ninety-one per cent of the OEST group did not return to income support within 
six months following their exit date, compared with 89% of job seekers in the comparison group.
OEST participant experience
‚Ä¢ Seventy-one per cent of the OEST group were satisfied or very satisfied with online employment 
services and 8% were dissatisfied. The level of satisfaction with provider services for the 
comparison group was similar (67% and 14% respectively).
‚Ä¢ OEST participants identified various advantages of online employment servicing such as the 
convenience of being able to access services from home or other places (68%) and at their own 
time or after business hours (58%). Participants also agreed that not having to attend 
appointments with a jobactive provider was a significant advantage that gave them more time to 
look for work (50%).
‚Ä¢ Some cohorts of OEST participants reported difficulties with aspects of online servicing. These
participants tended to be older, had limited IT skills and/or did not have a computer at home.
This conforms with existing literature findings that identify age and low internet usage and/or 
access as factors impacting on digital exclusion.
‚Ä¢ jobactive providers interviewed for the evaluation expressed concern that online servicing was 
not suitable for certain Stream A job seekers. Providers also indicated that their experiences had 
shown that participants‚Äô barriers were not always disclosed. Providers noted that digital literacy
screening did not form part of the trial (this has since been developed and implemented as part 
of digital servicing).
2
jobactive providers were not eligible for an employment outcome payment if OEST participants who transferred from the 
trial were placed into employment within their first 90 days of the transfer. This is consistent with outcome payment 
arrangements for Stream A job seekers in jobactive.
Online Employment Services Trial Evaluation| 19
‚Ä¢ Feedback suggests that appropriate targeting of the eligibility criteria is a vital component of an 
effective online employment services model.
Summary
The evaluation found that online servicing is an efficient way to deliver employment services to the 
most job-ready participants, with only a small percentage of job seekers indicating difficulty in 
accessing or trusting the necessary website functionality.
The OEST was as effective as provider-based servicing in delivering employment services to the most 
job-ready job seekers. OEST participants were as likely as job seekers in the comparison group to exit 
employment services and income support within six months of commencement.
The majority of OEST participants were satisfied with OEST and the jobactive website, reflecting the 
quality of the online platform. Most respondents surveyed (from both the OEST and comparison 
groups) agreed that online services should be the default or ‚Äòfirst option‚Äô for providing employment 
services to job seekers who have just started looking for a job.
Given the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of online servicing, this evaluation provides evidence 
that supports the Government‚Äôs broad move towards digital services for the most job-ready job 
seekers. In particular, it provides firm evidence for rolling out the Online Employment Service in 
the 2020‚Äì21 Budget.
As online servicing is expanded over the coming years, it is important to ensure it is targeted at the 
most job-ready job seekers. Overall, the low opt-out rates and employment outcomes suggest 
eligibility was generally well targeted. However, the evaluation confirmed international and 
Australian research that job seekers most likely to experience difficulties with online employment 
servicing are those with low levels of digital literacy and lack of job search skills",,Employment,,,,,,,,,Online Employment Se...~https://www.dewr.gov.au/employment-services-evaluations/online-employment-services-trial-evaluation,,,Original database,,,,Employment Services,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Unsure,The sample size is not given.,"The study did not explicitly mention statistically significant results. However, it reported that"
DEWR,Utilising soft skills training to enhance work readiness,2022,"The Australian Government provides a range of support to help unemployed people into work. Many 
job seekers can find work relatively quickly and may only need basic support, such as help with job 
search. On the other hand, job seekers with more complex barriers to employment (and further 
education) will often require a significant change in personal circumstances and a conducive external 
economic environment to find work.
Time spent unsuccessfully looking for work can also erode individuals‚Äô confidence and reduce their 
motivation to search for work, compounding the existing barriers to employment. Long-term 
joblessness can therefore have scarring effects, resulting in a greater chance of future periods of 
unemployment, lower lifetime earnings and poorer physical and mental health.
This context highlights the potential benefits of government support that works with disadvantaged 
job seekers, often with long durations of unemployment, to recover and strengthen their work 
readiness. This improvement in work readiness may also complement other forms of employment 
assistance or other courses of action undertaken by the job seeker to find work.
Testing ‚Äòsoft skills‚Äô or work readiness training 
The Department of Education, Skills and Employment (the department) assesses the relative 
disadvantage of job seekers using the Job Seeker Classification Instrument (JSCI), which is a 
questionnaire used to measure the risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Responses to a series of 
questions are used to help identify what level of support the job seeker will need to help them find 
work. Based on their JSCI scores and other supplementary assessments, job seekers are initially 
allocated to either Stream A (where job seekers are the most job ready) or Stream B (where job 
seekers need a greater level of support to help them become job ready). The JSCI also identifies 
whether a job seeker has multiple or complex barriers to employment that require more intensive 
support through Stream C.
The department‚Äôs Behavioural Economics Expertise Section set out to test a training solution to 
improve work readiness, with a particular focus on more disadvantaged job seekers in Stream B and 
C. The objectives for the solution included:
1. Initially build confidence, resilience and motivation to go out and find work.
2. Build on this by ensuring job seekers had the tools and resources they needed to find work, 
such as practical advice to improve their job search skills.
The department collaborated with Bounce Australia1
(Bounce) to help develop and deliver the 
training program. The training program incorporated techniques underpinned by behavioural 
insights, which helped job seekers make positive steps to building their confidence, self-esteem, 
resilience and life satisfaction. These psychological work readiness indicators can be thought as a
category of soft skills ‚Äì the other being more traditional forms of soft skills, such as communication

and teamwork skills. Specifically, the trial tested a 3-week training program aimed at maintaining 
and building job seeker‚Äôs soft skills, focusing on improving the psychological work readiness of 
Stream B and C job seekers.
A randomised controlled trial (RCT) methodology was used to assess the effectiveness of the 
training. To assess their change in soft skills over the course of the trial, job seekers were sent a soft 
skills assessment to complete prior to the trial and the same assessment after the trial. The 
assessment contained four different psychometric tools used to assess soft skills and psychological 
work readiness (32 questions). The trial ran from March 2019 to December 2019 and involved 319 
job seekers.
Our key findings
Overall, the trial found the training to be beneficial for Stream B and C job seekers, having a positive 
and statistically significant impact on their life satisfaction, self-esteem and resilience2
. Table 1 
illustrates the number of job seekers that moved from low levels self-esteem, resilience and life 
satisfaction to higher levels after attending the training.
Table 1: Key findings

Self-esteem Low to Average or High 39 47.6
Self-esteem Average to High 14 9.9
Resilience Low to Average or High 51 50.5
Resilience Average to High 7 5.7
Note: Percentage change is calculated by dividing the number of job seekers who moved into a higher scoring bracket 
following the training by the base number of job seekers in that group after the pre-intervention survey. For example, 
there were 85 job seekers who had low life satisfaction after completing the pre-intervention survey. Of that, 44 job 
seekers increased their life satisfaction to average or high in the post-intervention survey, equalling a 51.8 per cent change.
These findings suggest improvements to the precursors to employment, or job seekers‚Äô 
psychological work readiness, are possible by utilising soft skills training. Particularly when 
implemented alongside other tailored support, such as occupational3
, foundation and job search 
skills, this may help disadvantaged job seekers maintain or build the confidence and positive habits 
that lead to a return to employment (Koopman et al, 2017). That is, increased self-esteem, resilience 
and life satisfaction in turn may improve job search effectiveness and therefore the likelihood of 
employment4

DEWR,Applying Behavioural Economics to Increase the Take-up of Wage Subsidies Report,2018,"Executive Summary
Wage subsidies are payments to encourage businesses to employ eligible job seekers.
In 2016, the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT), the Applied and Behavioural Economics Section and the 
Incentives and Investments Branch of the Australian Government Department of Jobs and Small 
Business (formerly the Department of Employment, furthermore referred to as the Department), in 
partnership with jobactive employment services provider Mission Providence, co-designed and 
implemented a behavioural economics trial with the aim of increasing the take-up of Australian 
Government wage subsidies.
The early research phases of the project identified three main areas for improvement in the way wage 
subsidies were delivered: (i) administrative complexities for both jobactive providers and employers; (ii) 
financial incentives for employers not being framed correctly; and (iii) social incentives not being taken 
into consideration as a complement to the payments.
The new behavioural economics trial did not change the amount of the subsidies or the policy, but 
rather looked at testing small changes, including:
improving administrative processes, by making wage subsidy agreements easier for employers to 
understand and allowing them to sign online with an electronic signature;
restructuring of payment instalments to increase attractiveness and enhance loss aversion of 
employers; and 
improving communication and marketing materials for jobactive staff to promote wage subsidies 
to job seekers and employers.
The new approach was tested across five of Mission Providence‚Äôs sites in South West Sydney, on a 
sample of 1,436 employers, between 25 July 2016 and 1 November 2016. The effectiveness of the new
approach was evaluated using a cluster Randomised Control Trial, with a stepped-wedge design.
We found that our trial caused an increase in the number of wage subsidy agreements signed. 
Specifically, an additional two agreements were signed per month at each site. While the higher level of 
agreements signed is associated with higher average hours worked per placement (an average of two 
hours per week per wage subsidy), there was also a small reduction in the likelihood of being employed 
for four weeks, 12 weeks and 26 weeks. However, apart from the average hours worked per placement, 
these differences were not significant at conventional levels. The intervention also resulted in a 
reduction in the time taken to finalise an agreement (from an average of 17 to 11 days), although this 
did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. We also found a large and statistically 
significant increase in promotional activity by 60 per cent.
These results suggest that the intervention was effective in increasing the number of wage subsidy 
agreements signed online, but due to a lower than expected sample size, our trial ultimately did not 
allow us to be more definitive about the efficacy of the changes made.
The insights and results from this trial show how financial incentives per se might often not be sufficient 
if not informed by how individuals really behave. Based on an improved understanding of employers‚Äô 
preferences and jobactive provider staff behaviour, this trial shows that small changes to the existing 
policy can have a significant effect.
Feedback received during the trial fine-tuned the final design and implementation of operational policy 
changes to wage subsidies announced in the 2016 Budget and implemented nationally on 
1 January 2017. These include:
Giving employers longer to sign up to an agreement: wage subsidy agreements can be signed up 
to 12 weeks after the job starting, extended from four weeks.
Making the application and payment processes easier: improving online functionality for 
employers and providers to simplify eligibility, agreements and claim processes.
Providing more timely financial support: a discretionary kickstart payment option of up to 
40 per cent can be made four weeks after the job seeker starts in the job.
All wage subsidies paid to employers over six months instead of the previous 12 months.
Increasing flexibility for employers and job seekers: moving to an average of 20 hours worked per 
week over the six month agreement rather than a minimum requirement of 15 hours per week 
worked",,Employment,,,,,,,,,Applying Behavioural...~https://www.dewr.gov.au/employment-research-and-statistics/resources/applying-behavioural-economics-increase-take-wage-subsidies,,,Original database,,,,Employment Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,"A cluster Randomised Control Trial, with a stepped-wedge design.","1,436",The study did not show statistically significant results for most outcomes.

ATO,Testing deliberate choice letters to increase tax compliance,2023,"In the Australian Income Tax system, individual taxpayers are entitled to claim deductions for expenses 
incurred while earning salary and wage income. These deductions are called work related expenses. 
According to Taxation Statistics, work related expense deductions grew by 15 per cent from 2010-11 to 
2015 16. In 2015-16, 8.6 million taxpayers claimed nearly $22 billion in work related expense deductions. 
There is evidence that claims for work-related expense deductions can be erroneous and there is a 
propensity to over claim, including in returns prepared by tax agents. In his National Press Club address on 
5 July 2017, the Commissioner of Taxation expressed concern about the accuracy of work-related expense 
claims related to work, clothing and vehicles in the 2014-15 financial year. While individual amounts overclaimed can be small, the sum and overall revenue impact is significant. The Commissioner estimated the 
overall revenue impact was in the vicinity of $2.5 billion. 
Research by H&R Block in 2016 indicated one in five taxpayers believed misrepresentation of tax return 
information isn‚Äôt so bad, and 71 per cent believed they could claim something they were not entitled to 
(Lonergan Research 2016). PhD research (Wurth 2013) found tax agents rated their clients‚Äô work-related 
expense claims as the ‚Äòleast compliant‚Äô label on the tax return. Behavioural insights offers a low-cost tool to 
address these behaviours and underlying attitudes and help taxpayers willingly comply with the tax system. 
The Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government (BETA) partnered with the Australian 
Taxation Office (ATO) to examine the extent to which behaviourally-informed communications to tax agents 
could reduce erroneous work related expense claims. In particular, we tested the effectiveness of a letter 
sent to tax agents drawing on behavioural insights to address social norms.
We used a randomised controlled trial to test the impact of sending this letter to tax agents whose clients 
had higher than expected work-related expense claims compared to their peers. The letter specifically 
identified each agent‚Äôs clients who had lodged higher than expected claims (referred to as ‚Äòidentified 
clients‚Äô). There were over 2,000 tax agents in the trial, who were randomly assigned to a letter group or a 
‚Äòno letter‚Äô control group.
17 per cent of agents in the letter group lodged amendments, compared with 1 per cent of agents in the ‚Äòno 
letter‚Äô group. On average, identified clients represented by agents in the letter group reduced their work 
related expense claims by $191, compared with a $2 increase in the ‚Äòno letter‚Äô group. Overall, identified 
clients reduced their work-related expense claims by a total of $2.2 million. If we had sent the letter to all 
agents in the trial, including those who did not receive a letter, we expect this simple messaging 
intervention would have decreased work related expense deductions by about $4.4 million.
The letter led to an increase in the average total tax paid per client of $76, for a total of $0.9 million. If we 
had sent the letter to all agents in the trial, total tax revenue would have increased by an estimated $1.7 
million. We cannot be sure about the contribution of the reduction in work-related expense claims to the 
increase in tax paid, because amendments to tax return labels other than work-related expenses could 
have influenced the net tax position. 
Overall, these findings indicate low-cost, well-targeted and well-designed communications incorporating 
behavioural insights are effective in reducing erroneous work-related expense claims although the length of 
time for which this behavioural change is sustained remains unknown",,Tax,,,,,,,,,https://iorder.com.au/publication/Download.aspx?ProdID=1-XCZ3YO9-P1,,,Original database,,,,Tax Compliance,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,"Over 2,000 tax agents.","Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Tseng et al,Early Years Education Program,"2017, 2018, 2019, 2019, 2022","Overview of main findings
This report presents findings on the impact on children 
and their primary caregivers of 24 months of enrolment in 
the Early Years Education Program (EYEP). After 24 months 
the impact of attending EYEP on children and their 
families is broad and powerful. Large positive impacts of 
EYEP are found on children‚Äôs cognitive and non-cognitive 
development ‚Äì primarily IQ, protective factors related to 
resilience and social-emotional development. There is also 
some evidence that EYEP improves children‚Äôs language 
skills and lowers the psychological distress of their 
primary caregivers. 
EYEP and the research trial
EYEP is a centre-based, early years care and education 
program targeted at the needs of children who 
are exposed to significant family stress and social 
disadvantage, including being at heightened risk of, or 
having experienced, abuse and neglect. The program 
has a dual focus: to address the consequences of family 
stress on children‚Äôs development and to redress learning 
deficiencies. The ultimate objective of EYEP is to ensure 
that at-risk and vulnerable children realise their full 
potential, and arrive at school developmentally equal to 
their peers and equipped to be successful learners. 
Children who participate in EYEP are offered three years 
of care and education (50 weeks per year, five hours per 
day each week). Key features of EYEP are high staff/child 
ratios, qualified and experienced staff, inclusion of an infant 
mental health consultant as a member of the staff, and a 
rigorously developed curriculum. 
The impact of EYEP is being evaluated through a 
Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) as part of the Early Years 
Education Research Program (EYERP); otherwise referred to 
in this report as the ‚ÄòEYEP trial‚Äô. Children for whom consent 
was given to participate in the EYEP trial were randomly 
assigned into either an intervention group who were 
enrolled in EYEP or to a control group. Estimates of the 
impact of EYEP on children and their primary caregivers 
are derived from comparisons of outcomes between 
the groups. 
Characteristics of children and primary caregivers in 
the EYEP trial
To be eligible for the EYEP trial, children had to be aged 
less than 36 months at the time of entry to the trial, 
assessed as having two or more risk factors as defined in 
the Department of Human Services 2007 Best Interest Case 
Practice Model, be currently engaged with family services 
or child protection services and have early education as 
part of their care plan. 
The eligibility criteria enabled the selection of a group 
of participants in the EYEP trial for whom the program 
was designed ‚Äì children with substantial developmental 
delay living in families experiencing high levels of stress 
(Tseng et al., 2017). Compared with a general population 
of children, participants in the EYEP trial are highly 
disadvantaged on a variety of dimensions. EYEP trial 
participants had lower birth weight and, at the time of 
entry to the trial, had compromised development of 
IQ, language skills, motor skills and adaptive behaviour. 
The primary caregivers of children in the EYEP trial have 
lower levels of labour force engagement and family 
income, are more likely to experience stressful events 
and have higher levels of psychological distress than the 
general population of caregivers.
Outcomes
The main objective of the EYEP trial is to test whether 
the program is meeting its goal to improve children‚Äôs 
cognitive and non-cognitive skills (Jordan et al., 2014, p. 3). 
Outcomes relating to children‚Äôs cognitive skills (IQ and 
language skills) and their non-cognitive skills (within-child 
protective factors related to resilience and social-emotional 
development) are therefore examined. Possible impacts of 
EYEP on primary caregivers are evaluated using outcomes 
4 Report on impact of EYEP after 24 months
relating to perceptions of the level of stress they are 
experiencing and the quality of home environment. 
Sample size
A total of 145 children were recruited to the EYEP trial. 
These children come from 99 families. There are 72 children 
who are in the intervention group and 73 in the control 
group, and respectively 50 and 49 families in those groups. 
There are 64 girls and 81 boys in the trial. 
Over time, there has been attrition from the group of 
145 children who were originally recruited to the EYEP trial. 
The data collection at 24 months, on which the analysis 
in this report primarily relies, obtained responses from 
104 children and their primary caregivers. In addition, 
it was not possible to collect a complete set of data on 
outcomes for all these 104 children and primary caregivers. 
Hence, the analysis of the impact of EYEP on outcomes at 
24 months is based on samples that usually consist of 85 to 
95 children or primary caregivers.
Empirical method
Initial random assignment of participants in the EYEP trial 
achieved balance in the characteristics of the intervention 
and control groups. However, due to subsequent attrition 
of participants from the trial, by the time data were 
collected on outcomes at 24 months, several characteristics 
were no longer balanced. Some characteristics which 
are unbalanced are likely to affect children‚Äôs outcomes at 
24 months. Hence, it is not possible to estimate the impact 
of EYEP simply by comparing the average outcomes for 
children in the intervention and control groups. Instead, 
for the estimated impact of EYEP to reflect only the effect 
of participation in the program, it is necessary to use 
empirical methods that can correct for differences in 
characteristics between the groups. For this study we have 
applied two alternative methods to estimate the impact 
of EYEP ‚Äì a regression method and a propensity score 
matching method. 
What is the ‚Äòimpact‚Äô of EYEP that is estimated in 
this study?
The impact of EYEP is estimated for children who attended 
the program for at least 60 days over 24 months (out of 
a possible total of approximately 480 days). We restrict 
our attention to this sample in order that all children in 
the intervention group have had a level of exposure to 
EYEP that could conceivably be expected to affect their 
development. This is the same approach as was taken in 
estimating the impact of EYEP after twelve months (Tseng 
et al., 2018).
The impact of EYEP on outcomes for children after 
24 months is likely to derive from two sources: first, 
children in the intervention group receiving a larger 
number of hours of early years care and education 
services than the control group (for example, over the first 
24 months, children enrolled in EYEP received an average 
of 20.4 hours per week of formal early years care and 
education compared with 15.7 hours per week for children 
in the control group); and second, differences between the 
design and attributes of EYEP and the services received by 
the control group. 
Main findings
Large and statistically significant EYEP impacts are found 
at 24 months for several outcomes for children: (i) IQ; (ii) 
protective factors related to resilience; and (iii) socialemotional development. There is also a relatively large 
impact on children‚Äôs language skills, but this estimate has 
limited statistical significance. 
The estimated impact on IQ is one-third to one-half of a 
standard deviation. This compares with average impacts on 
IQ from early years demonstration programs in the United 
States of about one-quarter of a standard deviation. The 
estimated impact on within-child protective factors related 
to resilience is about one-third of a standard deviation. The 
proportion of children enrolled in EYEP who are classified 
in the clinical range for social-emotional development is 
lower by 30 percentage points compared with the control 
group, a substantial impact. 
Evidence that EYEP is having an impact on the stress 
experienced by primary caregivers is emerging at 
24 months. Primary caregivers of children in EYEP show 
a reduced level of distress on the Kessler Psychological 
Distress K6 Scale (K6) of about 1.5 points (on a zero to 
30 points scale), which is marginally statistically significant. 
Participation in EYEP is also estimated to be associated 
with small decreases in the frequency (one point on zero 
to 80 points scale) and in intensity (three points on zero 
to 100 points scale) of parenting daily hassles, but these 
estimates are not statistically significant. The estimated 
Report on impact of EYEP after 24 months 5
impact of EYEP on the home environment is small and not 
statistically significant. 
Major differences are apparent in the impact of EYEP on 
boys and girls ‚Äì especially for non-cognitive skills. For 
children‚Äôs IQ and language skills the estimated impacts 
are larger and have higher levels of statistical significance 
for boys than girls. For protective factors related to 
resilience a large and highly significant impact is found 
for boys, compared to a zero impact for girls. By contrast, 
the estimated impact of EYEP on social-emotional 
development exhibits the opposite pattern, with a much 
larger impact for girls than boys. Impacts on outcomes for 
primary caregivers at 24 months are confined to families 
with girls enrolled in EYEP. For the primary caregivers of 
girls there is a decrease in psychological distress and in 
the frequency of parenting hassles. There is, however, no 
evidence of an impact on these outcomes for the primary 
caregivers of boys. 
The timing of the impact of EYEP over the first 24 months 
has varied across outcomes. The impact of EYEP on children‚Äôs 
IQ appears to have been concentrated in the initial twelve 
months of the program, as the estimated impact size does 
not change appreciably between twelve months and 
24 months. This result is consistent with evidence from 
previous trials of early years demonstration programs in the 
United States. Other outcomes for children show a more 
pronounced impact from EYEP after the second year of 
being enrolled in the program. The estimated impact on 
children‚Äôs language skills increases from zero after twelve 
months to about three to four points after 24 months. For 
protective factors related to resilience the estimated impact 
size after 24 months is two to three times larger than after 
twelve months. While distinguishing the exact timing of 
impact on social-emotional development is difficult, there 
does seem to have been a positive impact spread across 
both the first and second years of the program. Where there 
have been positive outcomes for primary caregivers, these 
have been concentrated in the second year of their child‚Äôs 
enrolment in EYEP",,Early years,,,,,,,,,Changing children's ...~https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/research/education/early-years-education,,,Original database,,,,Education Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,145,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

"Ilya Klauzner, Suzanne Poynton, Don Weatherburn and Hamish Thorburn",The Youth on Track randomised trial,2022,"Background
Youth on Track is an early intervention scheme that was introduced in 2013 to help reduce the risk of young people re-offending. The scheme assigns young people to caseworkers for up to 12 months. Caseworkers administer interventions to the young person, including cognitive-behavioural and family interventions. They can also refer young people to external services to address criminogenic needs and engage with schools to increase attendance. Youth on Track is only available in seven sites in NSW and for young people who have never had a supervised order.

Between August 2017 and June 2020, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) was implemented to evaluate the Youth on Track program. A brief intervention called Fast Track was created as the control arm to ensure some level of treatment for all young people participating in the RCT. Fast Track was capped at six weeks of case management. Caseworkers did not deliver any structured interventions to the young person, but could refer them to external services.
We examined whether there were any differences in recidivism, education, employment, community activity, and housing outcomes between Youth on Track and Fast Track participants.

Key findings
For both the 12- and 24-month follow-up periods, there were no statistically significant differences between Youth on Track and Fast Track, in the proportion of young people who reoffended or entered custody. After adjusting for important characteristics, we estimate that 48.2% of Fast Track participants reoffended within 12 months compared with 50.6% of Youth on Track participants. Youth on Track participants were 3.2 percentage points less likely to reoffend and 3.5 percentage points less likely to enter custody within 24 months, but these differences were not statistically significant. We found that in certain subgroups, Youth on Track participants had much larger reductions in offending and custody.

We also found that Youth on Track participants were 6.2 percentage points more likely to be in employment at the end of their program and worked one hour more each week, on average, compared with Fast Track participants. Youth on Track participants were also 1.5 percentage points less likely to be in out-of-home care at program exit. Both these differences were statistically significant. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of school attendance, involvement in community activities or stable accommodation at program exit.

Conclusion
Youth on Track participants had similar reoffending and custody rates to Fast Track participants. Variability in the implementation of the scheme across sites and over time may partially explain these effects. Further research should be undertaken to examine the efficacy of key aspects of the program, including the risk assessment tool and behavioural intervention.",,,,,,,,,,,https://bocsar.nsw.gov.au/research-evaluations/2022/cjb249-summary-youth-on-track.html,,,Original database,,,,Criminal Justice,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The study showed statistically significant results in employment and out-of-home care outcomes.
"Sara Rahman, Suzanne Poynton, Don Weatherburn",The NSW Rolling List Court Evaluation ,2017,"Aim
To assess whether the application of an alternative court model with fixed teams of lawyers operating on a rolling basis in the NSW District Criminal Court resulted in greater efficiency in the resolution of indictable criminal matters relative to the regular operation of the NSW District Court, and to identify the successful elements and mechanisms of the Rolling List Court (RLC) model.
 
Method
A randomised controlled trial was conducted in the NSW District Criminal Court (NSW DCC), where eligible matters were balloted with 50:50 odds to the RLC or the general list of the NSW DCC. The proportion of early guilty pleas relative to late guilty pleas, trials reaching a verdict and no-bills were compared between the courts, and survival analysis was used to analyse the time taken to reach a guilty plea and to finalise matters in both courts. Stakeholder interviews were conducted to identify the key mechanisms behind the RLC, as well as any other benefits or drawbacks of the model.
 
Results
More than half (58.0 %) of the matters balloted to the RLC resolved in a guilty plea before the trial date, compared to 22.0 per cent of the matters randomised to the general list of the NSW DCC. There were marked improvements in the average time taken to reach a guilty plea (t=-3.43; p-value<.001), to list matters for trial (t=-5.14; p-value<.001) and to finalise matters (t=-3.93; p-value<.001) in the RLC. Further evidence of faster resolution in the RLC was found through survival analyses of the time taken to reach a guilty plea (HR=1.73; 95% CI (1.08, 2.78); p-value=.023) and to finalise matters (HR=1.90; 95% CI (1.29, 2.79); p-value=.001). Stakeholders interviewed indicated that early briefing and negotiation was crucial to obtaining earlier guilty pleas, and further benefits to efficiency arose from the fixed-team composition of the court.
 
Conclusion
The RLC proved effective at obtaining early guilty pleas and reducing delay in the processing of indictable criminal matters. The findings suggest that efforts to introduce some elements of the RLC, such as early briefing of practitioners and pre-trial negotiations, could have benefits for the NSW DCC's efficiency.",,Crime and justice,,,,,,,,,https://bocsar.nsw.gov.au/documents/publications/cjb/cjb201-250/cjb208-report-the-nsw-rolling-list-court-evaluation-fianl-report.pdf,,,Original database,,,,Criminal Justice Reform,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Champion et al,Health4Life eHealth intervention to modify multiple lifestyle risk behaviours among adolescent students in Australia: a cluster-randomised controlled trial,2023,"Lifestyle risk behaviours are prevalent among adolescents and commonly co-occur, but current intervention approaches tend to focus on single risk behaviours. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the eHealth intervention Health4Life in modifying six key lifestyle risk behaviours (ie, alcohol use, tobacco smoking, recreational screen time, physical inactivity, poor diet, and poor sleep, known as the Big 6) among adolescents.
Methods
We conducted a cluster-randomised controlled trial in secondary schools that had a minimum of 30 year 7 students, in three Australian states. A biostatistician randomly allocated schools (1:1) to Health4Life (a six-module, web-based programme and accompanying smartphone app) or an active control group (usual health education) with the Blockrand function in R, stratified by site and school gender composition. All students aged 11‚Äì13 years who were fluent in English and attended participating schools were eligible. Teachers, students, and researchers were not masked to allocation. Primary outcomes were alcohol use, tobacco use, recreational screen time, moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sugar-sweetened beverage intake, and sleep duration at 24 months, measured by self-report surveys, and analysed in all students who were eligible at baseline. Latent growth models estimated between-group change over time. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12619000431123).
Findings
Between April 1, 2019, and Sept 27, 2019, we recruited 85 schools (9280 students), of which 71 schools with 6640 eligible students (36 schools [3610 students] assigned to the intervention and 35 [3030 students] to the control) completed the baseline survey. 14 schools were excluded from the final analysis or withdrew, mostly due to a lack of time. We found no between-group differences for alcohol use (odds ratio 1¬∑24, 95% CI 0¬∑58‚Äì2¬∑64), smoking (1¬∑68, 0¬∑76‚Äì3¬∑72), screen time (0¬∑79, 0¬∑59‚Äì1¬∑06), MVPA (0¬∑82, 0¬∑62‚Äì1¬∑09), sugar-sweetened beverage intake (1¬∑02, 0¬∑82‚Äì1¬∑26), or sleep (0¬∑91, 0¬∑72‚Äì1¬∑14) at 24 months.

experiments (RISE)",2000,"This is a restorative justice program that uses conferencing to repair the harm. The program is rated Promising. Participants had a statistically significant lower likelihood of committing violent offenses, and a greater likelihood of reporting a belief in the law, negative attitude toward reoffending, and greater effort to not drive drunk, compared with the control group. There were mixed findings in the rate of drunk driving, and no difference in property crimes, shoplifting, or recidivism.

A Promising rating implies that implementing the program may result in the intended outcome(s).

Program Description
Program Goals
The Reintegrative Shaming Experiments (RISE) in Canberra, Australia, were designed to measure the impact of ‚Äúrestorative policing‚Äù on both victims and the person who committed the offenses‚Äô perceptions of justice, as well as overall satisfaction following the conference. The experiments also investigated the impact of restorative justice diversionary practices, particularly those that used the Wagga Wagga conference model, on repeat offending. The ultimate goal of the conference is to repair the harm caused by the offense by bringing together the person who committed the offense, victim, and members of the community in a way that allows convicted persons to reintegrate into the community, and victims to return to their normal routines without fear of further victimization.

Program Theory
Restorative justice places both the victim and the person who committed the offense at the center of the framework, allowing the victim to express the harm caused, while allowing the person who committed the offense to take responsibility for his or her actions and make amends for the future. It is believed that a conference, which brings together the person who committed the offense, victim, and supportive individuals for both parties, is a less stigmatizing environment for person who committed the offense. Some scholars believe that conventional criminal justice process stigmatizes the person who committed the offense as an ‚Äúother,‚Äù excluding him or her and hindering the reintegration process. Therefore, it is believed that the reintegrative shaming process used in restorative justice conferences could have a far greater impact on the reoffending rate, as it expresses disapproval of their actions, yet offers support and belief in the individual for the future (Braithwaite 1989). Likewise, victims will have a more positive perception of justice and less fear of re-victimization by participating in restorative justice conferences, as they are able to have a voice in the process (Braithwaite and Mugford 1994). 

Program Components
The RISE experiments were conducted to test the impact of reintegrative shaming conferences used in restorative justice. Diversionary conferencing, particularly the Wagga Wagga model investigated in the RISE experiments, typically lasts 1‚Äì2 hours. During this time the person who committed the offense, victim, and supportive individuals for both parties discuss the crime, its impact, and reach an agreement on how the individual can make amends for the future. The Wagga Wagga model is different than other diversionary conferences in that the conference coordinator and facilitator is a police officer, and the conference is held at a police station; other diversionary conferences are held by non-police coordinators and facilitators at various other locations. In contrast to other restorative justice models, the Wagga Wagga conference model also used a great deal of reintegrative shaming.

The RISE experiments included those who had committed four types of offenses: drinking and driving, juvenile property offenses, juvenile shoplifting offenses, and youth violent offenses. The aim of the project was to include ‚Äúmiddle range‚Äù offenses, neither so trivial that they would normally be dealt with by a simple caution or warning, nor so serious that the police would be reluctant to bypass the court system in favor of an experimental alternative (serious, sexual, and domestic violence offenses were excluded).

Evaluation Outcomes
Study 1
Shoplifting Rate
There was no statistically significant difference found between the treatment and control groups in shoplifting rate.

Property Offense Rate
There was no statistically significant difference found between the treatment and control groups in property offense rate.

Violent Offense Rate
Sherman, Strang, and Woods (2000) found that participants in the diversionary conferencing treatment group had a lower rate of violent offenses, compared with the control group, at the one-year follow up. This difference was statistically significant.

Drinking and Driving Rate
Treatment group participants had a higher rate of drunk driving, compared with the control group at the one-year follow up. This difference was statistically significant.

Study 2
Self-Reported Belief in the Legitimacy of Law
Participants in the treatment group reported a greater belief in the legitimacy of the law, compared with the control group. This difference was statistically significant.

Police-Reported Recidivism
Tyler and colleagues (2007) found no statistically significant difference between participants in the diversionary conferencing treatment group and the control group in police-reported recidivism at the 2-year follow up.

Self-Reported Effort to Not Drive Drunk
Participants in the treatment group reported a greater effort to not drive drunk, compared with the control group. This difference was statistically significant.

Self-Reported Drinking and Driving
There was no statistically significant difference found between treatment and control groups in self-reported drunk driving.

Self-Reported Attitude Toward Reoffending
Participants in the treatment group were more likely to report that reoffending would have great impacts on their personal lives, compared with the control group. This difference was statistically significant.

Evaluation Methodology
Study 1
Sherman, Strang, and Woods (2000) investigated the recidivism behavior of individuals involved in diversionary restorative justice conferences. The Reintegrative Shaming Experiments (RISE) randomly assigned cases, rather than person who committed the offense, to either the treatment condition (conference) or to conventional court processing. A ‚Äúcase‚Äù was defined as all of the individuals who were apprehended together for the same criminal offense. Both males and females were included in the study, with an age range of 15‚Äì29. RISE took place between 1995 and 2000 in Canberra, Australia. New cases were accepted until July 1, 2000.

In this study, four offenses were analyzed: drinking and driving, juvenile property offenses, juvenile shoplifting offenses, and youth violent offenses.

Drinking and driving was defined as having blood alcohol content over .08. The drinking and driving subset consisted of 900 cases, with 900 individuals (450 for court processing and 450 for diversionary conferencing).
Juvenile property offenses was defined as offending with personal victims committed by persons under the age of 18, and included offenses such as theft, burglary, auto crime, or criminal damage. The juvenile property offending-personal victims subset included 162 cases, with 238 individuals (114 for court processing and 124 for diversionary conferencing).
Juvenile shoplifting offenses were offenses committed by individuals under the age of 18 and were detected by security staff. The juvenile shoplifting offenses subset consisted of 108 cases, with 135 individuals (62 for court processing and 73 for diversionary conferencing).
Youth violent offenses were offenses committed by individuals under the age of 30, and included offenses such as common assault or aggravated assault. The youth violence subset sample included 89 cases, with 110 individuals (52 for court processing and 58 for diversionary conferencing).
Repeat offending was calculated using criminal history data from the Australian Federal Police. This data includes the criminal trajectories of all individuals in each of the four offense categories. Most, but not all, offense categories included at least a 1-year follow-up period. The analysis examined before‚Äìafter differences in offending rates between the treatment and comparison groups. One limitation of the experiment is that it did not control for the person who committed the crime and victim differences within the offense categories. Therefore, preexisting differences could have impacted any similarities or differences both within offense categories, as well as between the control and experimental conditions. No subgroup analyses were conducted.

Study 2
Tyler and colleagues (2007) also used data from the RISE experiments to analyze the impact of restorative justice conferencing, specifically the reintegrative shaming aspect of the Wagga Wagga conference model, on recidivism and measures of support for the law. However, Tyler and colleagues only used data from the drinking and driving portion of the earlier study in their analysis. In this study, all participants were arrested between July 1995 and December 1997, with the majority of individuals arrested as a result of police conducting random breathalyzer tests in Canberra, Australia. A randomized design was used, with individuals randomly assigned to the restorative justice conference or traditional court processing (the control).

The impact of the restorative justice conferencing was analyzed using three different methods: an interview with them shortly following the conference or court processing regarding their experience; a follow-up interview with them two years after the conference or court processing regarding their experience; and the analysis of police records four years prior and four years following the conference or court processing.

Of the 900 individuals included in this study, 730 were interviewed shortly after the conference or court processing, with 377 individuals from the treatment condition and 353 from the control condition. Two years later, 620 individuals were interviewed regarding their experience, which included 313 individuals from the treatment condition and 307 from the control condition. Finally, police records included criminal activity for all 900 individuals four years prior and four years following the conference or court processing.

The first interview was conducted to investigate their experience in the conference or court processing. In this interview, they were asked to make judgments on the fairness of the conference or court processing, the fairness of police treatment, and the legitimacy of the legal system. The second interview, conducted two years after the conference or court processing, investigated their law-related attitudes. These interviews focused on their belief in the legitimacy of the law and the obligation they felt to obey the law, as well as the problems they believed breaking the law would create for their family or community. No subgroup analyses were conducted.",,Crime and justice,,,,,,,,,13 Nov 2017 - Austra...~https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/awa/20171112233316/http://www.aic.gov.au/criminal_justice_system/rjustice/rise/recidivism.html,,,Original database,"Tyler, T., Lawrence S., Heather S., Barnes, G. and Woods, D.

Method: The study employed a non-blinded randomised controlled trial to test the effect of IJS on early-phase substance use and sanctioning rates. All participants accepted onto the Parramatta Drug Court program between March 2010 and March 2011 were randomly allocated into either an IJS or supervision as usual (SAU) condition. The IJS group had phase 1 of their program extended from three to four months and appeared before the judge two times per week during phase 1. The SAU group appeared once per week for three months during phase 1.

Results: Participants in the IJS group were significantly less likely to return positive urinalysis tests and had a significantly greater number of episodes of abstinence than participants in the SAU group. IJS participants were less likely to accrue sanctions than participants in the SAU group. There was no significant difference in the odds of having sanctions waived or having to serve sanctions in prison between the two groups.

BETA,Nudge vs superbugs: a behavioural economics trial to reduce the overprescribing of antibiot\ics,2018,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest threats to human health today. AMR occurs when microorganisms, such as bacteria, become resistant to an antimicrobial medicine, such as antibiotics. Resistant infections are more difficult to treat and, in some cases, untreatable. It can affect anyone, of any age, and in any country.

Australians use a lot of antibiotics and this increases the chance for bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotics.

Within Australia, General Practitioners (GPs) currently prescribe the greatest portion of antibiotics due to the types of illnesses seen and the large volumes of patients. This makes GPs important partners in efforts to minimise AMR by helping limit community prescribing to only those clinical situations where evidence shows antibiotics to be of proven value.

We applied behavioural insights to design letters sent by the Australian Government‚Äôs Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to high-prescribing GPs. In particular, we used peer comparison by comparing GPs‚Äô prescribing rates with those of other GPs in their region.

We undertook a randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving 6,649 GPs to test the impact of our letters. Just as RCTs are regarded as the ‚Äògold standard‚Äô for testing clinical interventions, they are increasingly being used to determine what works in public policy.

As part of our RCT, the CMO wrote to GPs whose prescribing rates were in the top 30 per cent for their region. The letters aimed to prompt GPs to reflect on whether there were opportunities to reduce prescribing where appropriate and safe.

"Joula Dekker, Nadine Smith, Kate O'Brien",An evaluation of the compulsory drug treatment program (CDTP),2010,"In 2003, the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOCSAR) was directed by the NSW Government to undertake a randomised controlled trial of the Compulsory Drug Treatment Program (CDTP). This proved impossible because the number of offenders eligible for the program was never large enough to conduct a meaningful randomised controlled trial. The number of offenders dealt with on the program was also too small to evaluate its effect on rates of re-offending. The evaluation was therefore limited to assessing the impact of the CDTP on the health and wellbeing of participants, measuring changes in perceived coercion, affective reactions, treatment readiness and therapeutic alliance, gauging participant satisfaction with various aspects of the program, and monitoring participants‚Äô drug use whilst on the program.

The research involved a series of face-to-face interviews with CDTP participants. Baseline interviews were conducted with 95 participants at the commencement of their time on the program. Three followup interviews were conducted as close to the time that participants finished Stages 1, 2 and 3, as was practicable. By the time data collection ceased, 78 per cent of the baseline sample (74 participants) had completed Stage 1 and participated in one follow-up interview (end of Stage 1), and 41 per cent of the baseline sample (39 participants; for some measures information is missing for one participant so N = 38) had completed both Stages 1 and 2 and participated in two follow-up interviews (end of Stages 1 and 2). Of the baseline sample, 13.5 per cent (13 participants) had completed all three follow-up interviews (end of Stages 1, 2, and 3).

"Sara Rahman, Suzanne Poynton, Don Weatherburn",The NSW Rolling List Court evaluation: final report,2018,"Aim: To assess whether the application of an alternative court model with fixed teams of lawyers operating on a rolling basis in the NSW District Criminal Court resulted in greater efficiency in the resolution of indictable criminal matters relative to the regular operation of the NSW District Court, and to identify the successful elements and mechanisms of the Rolling List Court (RLC) model.

Method: A randomised controlled trial was conducted in the NSW District Criminal Court (NSW DCC), where eligible matters were balloted with 50:50 odds to the RLC or the general list of the NSW DCC. The proportion of early guilty pleas relative to late guilty pleas, trials reaching a verdict and no-bills were compared between the courts, and survival analysis was used to analyse the time taken to reach a guilty plea and to finalise matters in both courts. Stakeholder interviews were conducted to identify the key mechanisms behind the RLC, as well as any other benefits or drawbacks of the model.

Results: More than half (58.0 %) of the matters balloted to the RLC resolved in a guilty plea before the trial date, compared to 22.0 per cent of the matters randomised to the general list of the NSW DCC. There were marked improvements in the average time taken to reach a guilty plea (t=-3.43; p-value.001), to list matters for trial (t=-5.14; p-value.001) and to finalise matters (t=-3.93; p-value.001) in the RLC. Further evidence of faster resolution in the RLC was found through survival analyses of the time taken to reach a guilty plea (HR=1.73; 95% CI (1.08, 2.78); p-value=.023) and to finalise matters (HR=1.90; 95% CI (1.29, 2.79); p-value=.001). Stakeholders interviewed indicated that early briefing and negotiation was crucial to obtaining earlier guilty pleas, and further benefits to efficiency arose from the fixed-team composition of the court.

Conclusion: The RLC proved effective at obtaining early guilty pleas and reducing delay in the processing of indictable criminal matters. The findings suggest that efforts to introduce some elements of the RLC, such as early briefing of practitioners and pre-trial negotiations, could have benefits for the NSW DCC‚Äôs efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2018-01/apo-nid126916.pdf,,,APO search,,,,Criminal Justice,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Transitions out of long-term homelessness,2012,"Journey to Social Inclusion (J2SI) is a pilot project designed to break the cycle of long-term homelessness. The project provides intensive support for up to three years to assist people who are long-term homeless receive the range of services they need.

This is the second of four reports evaluating the J2SI project. It documents the social outcomes and the economic costs and benefits from the first 24 months. The evaluation uses a randomised controlled trial that tracks the outcomes of J2SI participants (Group J) and compares their outcomes with those of a comparison group (Group E) who are being supported by existing services.
After 24 months the evidence shows a sustained improvement in the housing circumstances of the J2SI participants compared to those in the control group. Critically, most (86%) have maintained their housing. While the move to independent housing was difficult in the beginning, the high rate of housing retention suggests that most of the participants are developing the skills and confidence needed to keep their housing.

"Sustainability Victoria, University of Technology Sydney",The Victorian Healthy Homes Program: research findings,2022,"The Victorian Healthy Homes Program was a randomised controlled trial designed to measure the impact of an energy efficiency and thermal comfort home upgrade on temperature, energy use, health and quality of life. Analysis indicated that a relatively minor upgrade (average $2,809) had wide-ranging benefits over the winter period.

Average indoor temperature was increased by 0.33 degrees Celsius, with increases particularly strong in the morning, when temperatures are lowest. Exposure to cold temperatures (less than 18 degrees Celsius) was reduced by 43 minutes per day. Subjective experience of warmth is important; it does not always match temperature measurements. Householders in the intervention group were more than twice as likely as controls to report that their home felt warmer over winter. These gains in thermal comfort were obtained despite a significant reduction in gas use in upgraded homes, and no change in electricity use. There was no evidence of a rebound effect, with intervention participants less likely than controls to use their main heater and less likely to resort to other options to stay warm. Householders in the intervention group reported less condensation over winter.

Importantly, the upgrade was associated with benefits in health, with reduced breathlessness and improved quality of life, particularly its mental health and social care aspects. Health benefits of the upgrade were reflected in cost savings, with $887 per person saved in the healthcare system over the winter period. Cost-benefit analysis indicated that the upgrade would be cost saving within 3 years ‚Äì and would yield a net saving of $4,783 over 10 years ‚Äì due to savings in both energy and health. Savings were heavily weighted towards healthcare: for every $1 saved in energy, more than $10 is saved in health.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,APO search,,,,Energy Efficiency,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,The description does not explicitly state whether the results were statistically significant.

Phase 2 of the program arose out of the success of a pilot study (Johnson et al., 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014) that demonstrated high rates of housing attainment and retention. Sacred Heart Mission (SHM) has enlisted the Centre for Social Impact at The University of Western Australia (CSI UWA), in collaboration with Swinburne University of Technology, to lead a longitudinal research study to evaluate the J2SI Phase 2 program. The research study is a randomised control trial (RCT) where eligible study participants, were randomised upon recruitment and after the Baseline survey into the J2SI Phase 2 program, termed the J2SI group, or the comparison group that continues to receive homelessness services as usual, termed the E group (existing services). Some of those randomised to the J2SI group were not able to be contacted by the J2SI Phase 2 program team, left the geographical area covered by the program or did not engage with the program. This group is labelled the ‚ÄòI group‚Äô (Inactive group). Those in the J2SI group who remained engaged at the 12-month point are referred to as the Active J2SI group.

This report presents findings at the Year One time point in which we compare outcomes at the Wave 3 time point with those at Baseline using survey data that were collected during interviews with research study participants. The findings cover a broad range of wellbeing domains, including housing, physical health, mental health, alcohol and other drug (AOD) issues, health service utilisation, economic participation, social support and quality of life. The report examines outcomes for study participants as a whole, outcomes at Wave 3 compared with the Baseline broken down by permanent housing status at Wave 3, and outcomes achieved for J2SI Phase 2 participants relative to other participants. A detailed analysis of the latter issue will be undertaken at the completion of the project and published in the final report.

One hundred and eighty valid responses were obtained at Baseline in the study‚Äôs longitudinal survey. For various reasons, including participant deaths, withdrawal from the study, and loss to follow-up, 134 complete responses were collected at Wave 3.

BETA,Improved compliance with the Deferred GST Scheme,2018,"The Australian Taxation Office is the Australian Government‚Äôs principal revenue collection agency and administers Australia‚Äôs tax system and significant aspects of Australia‚Äôs superannuation system. It administers legislation governing tax, superannuation and the Australian Business Register and supports the delivery of government benefits to the community. Improving tax compliance is a major policy goal as non-compliance can reduce the overall tax base, increase the costs of administration and lead to an uneven playing field for businesses doing the right thing.

As part of the legislation the Deferred Goods and Services Tax (DGST) Scheme allows businesses to defer the payment of GST on taxable imports until the goods have been sold. This helps businesses manage their cash flow. Cash flow is important for businesses because it helps them meet everyday business needs and avoid taking on more debt. This means there is a strong driver for businesses to be on the Scheme. Participation in the Scheme allows 13,000 businesses to defer payment of $26 billion in GST annually.

To be on the Scheme, businesses must comply with requirements including digital lodgment of monthly activity statements and being up to date on all lodgments and payments due to the ATO. At any one time about one in three businesses do not comply. The ATO can revoke access to the Scheme if a business does not fully comply, which negatively affects cash flow and means the business will need to reapply to be reinstated.

BETA partnered with the ATO to test behaviourally informed methods of communication (variations on emails) aimed at improving compliance among businesses in the Scheme. We ran two separate randomised controlled trials to test the effectiveness of these emails.

The first trial evaluated the impact of sending a ‚Äòcooperative‚Äô or ‚Äòdirect‚Äô toned reminder email to existing businesses who were found to be non-compliant with the Scheme. The aim was to encourage self-compliance, educate businesses on their tax obligations and reduce recurrent non-compliance. Both emails improved compliance rates but variations in the tone of the reminders did not affect the compliance rate.

The second trial tested the effectiveness of sending a welcome email to new businesses who had just registered on the Scheme. The aim of the email was to educate the businesses from the first point of contact to promote good compliance behaviours and engagement with the ATO. The email contained a planning prompt recommending businesses set up a monthly calendar reminder about their DGST obligations. It did not improve compliance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,APO search,,,,Tax Compliance,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,"The study showed statistically significant results for the first trial, where both 'co"

Indigenous children have higher levels of ECC compared with non-Indigenous children. The study aimed to estimate the efficacy of an ECC intervention among Aboriginal Australian children. Methods: Baby Teeth Talk was an outcome assessor-blinded, closed-cohort cross-in randomized controlled trial conducted in South Australia, Australia. We randomly allocated 448 women pregnant with an Aboriginal child to either an immediate (II) or delayed (DI) intervention group between January 2011 and May 2012. The immediate intervention comprised (1) provision of dental care to mothers during pregnancy; (2) application of fluoride varnish to teeth of children at ages 6, 12; and 18 mo; (3) motivational interviewing delivered in conjunction; and (4) anticipatory guidance. Mothers/children in the DI group received the same intervention commencing when the child was 24 mo of age. The outcomes were assessed by the number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth (dmft) in children aged 24, 36, and 60 mo. Regression-based approaches with generalized linear mixed effect (log-Poisson) model characterized the mean dmft to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: A total of 223 participants were randomly allocated to the II group and 225 to the DI group. Three hundred sixty-five children (178 II, 187 DI) received at least 1 dental clinical examination at 24, 36, and 60 mo of follow-up. The mean dmft was lower in the II group (0.48, 1.32, and 2.06) than in the DI group (0.82, 1.90, and 3.29) at each time point, respectively. The direct ECC intervention effect was to prevent/decrease dental decay experience (dmft) occurrence by 84% (RR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.20‚Äì2.48) after adjusting for all covariates. Conclusions: Our analysis indicated that the time-varied ECC intervention had immediate and longer-term effects on the prevention of ECC among Indigenous Australian children. Knowledge Transfer Statement: The study aimed to estimate the efficacy of an early childhood caries (ECC) intervention among Aboriginal Australian children. The findings indicated that the culturally appropriate ECC intervention is effective for the preventive of ECC and can be used by clinicians, educators, and policy makers when planning an ECC intervention, so as to prevent and reduce ECC and meet identified oral health needs across the Australian population, which is important for preventive dental care. ¬© The Author(s) 2023.",10.1177/23800844231191714,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Public Health,Full study with results.,Field experiment,Cross-in randomized controlled trial,448,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Accessing psychological treatments in a prison setting is a particular challenge, in part, due to difficulties accessing specialist mental health workers. Behavioural Activation (BA) may be helpful in improving health outcomes for people in custody experiencing depressive symptoms. The aim of this study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of custodial health nurses delivering BA to improve depressive symptoms of people in custody. We will conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial with process observation examining the feasibility and acceptability of BA in treating people in custody with depressive symptoms. 60 people in custody presenting with depressive symptoms will be randomised to receive BA plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU provided by custodial health nurses. Eight custodial health nurses will be recruited, trained, and deliver BA. BA will be delivered twice a week for six weeks, with sessions lasting up to 30 minutes. Changes in depression and quality of life (QoL) will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months post-intervention. Participants will be interviewed to understand feasibility and acceptability of BA in prison settings. The findings will inform the design of a randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of BA for people in custody with depression. Findings will help determine whether BA for depression is suited to prison health care system and services. Improving depressive symptoms in people in custody has benefits beyond prison settings. The Central Adelaide Local Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee and University of South Australia Human Research Ethics Committee have approved the study. The trial results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences and reported to local stakeholders and policy makers. If feasibility and acceptability is demonstrated, we will seek to progress to an effectiveness study. A potential strength of the trial model proposed, is in its scalability, with potential to increase the trial sites and locations.  ¬© 2024 Walsh et al.

Watchorn D.J.; Doherty T.S.; Wilson B.A.; Garkaklis M.J.; Driscoll D.A.,Artificial refuges did not increase small mammal abundance after fire,2024,"The interacting threats of invasive predators and altered fire regimes are key conservation issues for many native species globally. Artificial refuges have been proposed as a potential conservation tool to provide prey species with protection from invasive predators after fire, but we do not yet know whether they improve animal survival. To address this knowledge gap, we experimentally tested how small mammal abundance and species richness were influenced by the provision of artificial refuges after prescribed burns. We surveyed small mammals across five unburnt sites, seven burnt sites with artificial refuges, and eight burnt control sites following two prescribed fires in southeastern Australia. There were negative and neutral responses of small mammals to the burns, and relative abundance was positively correlated with structurally complex vegetation. Artificial refuges had no impact on abundance or species richness, irrespective of burn coverage. These findings suggest that this artificial refuge design may not be an effective tool for improving small mammal population persistence postfire, and as such we should not yet scale up their application. However, given the inherent context-dependency of field experiments involving fire, which include difficult-to-control variables such as fire severity, predator activity, and population dynamics, we encourage researchers to undertake further experiments with artificial refuges in fire-affected areas, including after severe wildfires when less vegetation cover remains. Such studies will help to build our understanding of their utility as a conservation tool across different ecosystems and fire types. ¬© 2024 The Authors.

Bentley L.A.; Eager R.; Savage S.; Nielson C.; White S.L.J.; Williams K.E.,"A translational application of music for preschool cognitive development: RCT evidence for improved executive function, self-regulation, and school readiness",2023,"The benefits of active music participation and training for cognitive development have been evidenced in multiple studies, with this link leveraged in music therapy approaches with clinical populations. Although music, rhythm, and movement activities are widely integrated into children's play and early education, few studies have systematically translated music therapy-based approaches to a nonclinical population to support early cognitive development. This study reports the follow-up effects of the Rhythm and Movement for Self Regulation (RAMSR) program delivered by generalist preschool teachers in low socioeconomic communities. This randomized control trial (RCT) involved 213 children across eight preschools in disadvantaged communities in Queensland, Australia. The intervention group received 16‚Äì20 sessions of RAMSR over 8 weeks, while the control group undertook usual preschool programs. Primary outcome measures included executive function (child assessment of shifting, working memory, and inhibition) and self-regulation (teacher report), with secondary outcomes of school readiness and visual-motor integration. Data were collected pre- and post-intervention, and again 6 months later once children had transitioned into school. Results demonstrated significant intervention effects across the three time points for school readiness (p¬†=¬†0.038, Œ∑p2¬†=¬†0.09), self-regulation (p¬†<¬†0.001, Œ∑p2¬†=¬†0.08), and inhibition (p¬†=¬†0.002 Œ∑p2¬†=¬†0.23). Additionally, the feasibility of building capacity in teachers without any music background to successfully deliver the program was evidenced. These findings are important given that children from low socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to need support for cognitive development yet have inequitable access to quality music and movement programs. Research Highlights: Initial effects of self-regulation from a rhythm and movement program were sustained following transition into school for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Delayed effects of inhibition and school readiness from a rhythm and movement program appeared 6 months post-intervention as children entered school. Generalist teachers can successfully implement a rhythm and movement program, which boosts critical developmental cognitive skills. ¬© 2022 The Authors.

Health authorities need evidence about effective communication interventions to improve acceptance and uptake. This study aimed to test effects of persuasive messages about COVID- 19 vaccine booster doses on intention to vaccinate amongst eligible adults in Australia. Methods In this online randomised controlled trial, adult participants received one of four intervention messages or a control message. The control message provided information about booster dose eligibility. Intervention messages added to the control message, each using a different persuasive strategy, including: emphasising personal health benefits of booster doses, community health benefits, non-health benefits, and personal agency in choosing vaccination. After the intervention, participants answered items about COVID-19 booster vaccine intention and beliefs. Intervention groups were compared to the control using tests of two proportions; differences of ‚â•5 percentage points were deemed clinically significant. A sub-group analysis was conducted among hesitant participants. Results Of the 487 consenting and randomised participants, 442 (90.8%) completed the experiment and were included in the analysis. Participants viewing messages emphasising non-health benefits had the highest intention compared to those who viewed the control message (percentage point diff: 9.0, 95% CI -0.8, 18.8, p = 0.071). Intention was even higher among hesitant individuals in this intervention group compared to the control group (percentage point diff: 15.6, 95% CI -6.0, 37.3, p = 0.150). Conversely, intention was lower among hesitant individuals who viewed messages emphasising personal agency compared to the control group (percentage point diff: -10.8, 95% CI -33.0, 11.4, p = 0.330), although evidence in support of these findings is weak. Conclusion Health authorities should highlight non-health benefits to encourage COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake but use messages emphasising personal agency with caution. These findings can inform communication message development and strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake.  ¬© 2023 Steffens et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0286799,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Public Health,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Randomised controlled trial (RCT),487,The study did not show statistically significant results.

Method The Personalised Health Care (PHC) pilot study was a randomised trial with an economic evaluation alongside over 12 months. From a health service perspective, the primary analysis compared the costs and effectiveness of PHC telehealth monitoring with usual care. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated based on costs and health-related quality of life. The PHC intervention was implemented in the Barwon Health region, Geelong, Australia, for patients with a diagnosis of COPD and/or diabetes who had a high likelihood of hospital readmission over 12 months. Results When compared to usual care at 12 months, the PHC intervention cost AUD$714 extra per patient (95%CI -4879; 6308) with a significant improvement of 0.09 in health-related quality of life (95%CI: 0.05; 0.14). The probability of PHC being cost-effective by 12 months was close to 65%, at willingness to pay a threshold of AUD$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year. Conclusion Benefits of PHC to patients and the health system at 12 months translated to a gain in quality- adjusted life years with a non-significant cost difference between the intervention and control groups. Given the relatively high set-up costs of the PHC intervention, the program may need to be offered to a larger population to achieve cost-effectiveness. Long-term follow- up is required to assess the real health and economic benefits over time.  ¬© 2023 Mudiyanselage et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0286533,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Healthcare Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The study showed a statistically significant improvement in health-related quality of life with the

A sample of 488 boys in grades 9 and 10 (Mage = 14.81, SDage = 0.51) at nine secondary schools in Australia were randomly assigned to Goodform (n = 244) or control (n = 244) at the school level. Self-reported body image, supplement use, anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) use, and attitudes around using AAS and muscle building supplements were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and eight-week follow-up. Analyses with multi-level, mixed-effect regression models revealed no changes over time attributable to the intervention. Our results have implications for researchers in the body image and eating disorder prevention fields. Lessons learned in this study can inform future school-based efforts for reducing muscle building supplement use. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.bodyim.2022.11.003,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Education Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,488,The study did not show statistically significant results.

The intervention facilitated their independent participation in mainstream community groups and volunteering. Methods: We randomised 29 older Australians who currently/previously worked in mainstream employment into an intervention group or wait-list control group. Hours of independent participation in target activities were collected before and after the 13-week initial intervention/waiting period, and at 52 weeks for intervention participants. Results: Six of the 12 intervention participants selected an activity and increased hours of independent participation following 13 weeks in the Keeping Active (KA) program and eight were independently accessing their selected activity at 52-week follow-up. None of the 19 wait-list participants increased their independent participation after 13 weeks.

Flaws D.; Allen C.; Baker S.; Barnett A.; Metcalf O.; Pollock H.; Ramanan M.; Tabah A.; Varker T.,"A protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial of an Early Psychiatric Assessment, Referral, and Intervention Study (EPARIS) for intensive care patients",2023,"Background Up to 80% of Intensive Care Unit patients experience physical, cognitive, and/or psychological complications post-discharge, known as ‚ÄòPost Intensive Care Syndrome‚Äô (PICS). Early diagnosis and intervention are a priority, but while current post-intensive care follow-up processes endorse a multidisciplinary model, incorporating a psychiatric consultation has not been studied. Methods A pilot, open-label randomised controlled trial was developed by a multidisciplinary team to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of incorporating a psychiatric review into an existing post-ICU clinic. The study will run for 12 months and aim to recruit 30 participants. Inclusion criteria for participants: a) ICU admission greater than 48 hours, b) no cognitive impairment that prevents participation, c) ‚â• 18 years old, d) residing in Australia, e) fluent in English, f) able to provide GP information, and g) likely to be contactable in 6 months. Patient recruitment will be at Redcliffe Hospital, Queensland, Australia, and will involve patients attending the Redcliffe post intensive care clinic. Participants will be allocated to intervention or control using block randomisation and allocation concealment. Participants allocated to the control arm will receive the standard cares provided by the clinic, which involves an unstructured interview about their ICU experience and a battery of surveys about their psychological, cognitive, and physical function. Those allocated to the intervention arm will receive these same cares as well as an appointment with a psychiatrist for a single session intervention. The psychiatric intervention will involve a comprehensive review, including comorbid disorders, substance use, suicidal ideation, psychosocial stressors, social/emotional supports. Psychoeducation and initial treatment will be provided as indicated and recommendations given to the patient and their GP about how to access ongoing care. In addition to surveys conducted as part of standard clinic cares, all participants will complete additional questionnaires about their history, hospital experience, mental and physical health as well as employment circumstances. All participants will be followed up 6 months after their appointment and will be invited to complete follow-up questionnaires about their mental and physical health, as well as health service use and employment circumstances. The trial has been registered with ANZCTR (ACTRN12622000894796). Results To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention to the patient population. Differences between groups will be assessed using an independent samples t-test. Resource requirements to administer the intervention will be evaluated by reporting the mean duration of the EPARIS assessment and approximate cost per patient to provide this service. To estimate the effect size of any treatment effects, changes in secondary outcome measures between baseline and 6 months will be compared between intervention and control groups using Analysis of Covariance regression. As this is a pilot, we will not use p-values or test a null hypothesis, but will give confidence intervals. Conclusions This protocol provides a pragmatic evaluation of the acceptability of introducing early psychiatric assessment into an existing post-ICU follow-up process, and if considered acceptable will inform future research into the efficacy and generalisability of the intervention. The strengths of EPARIS are the prospective, longitudinal design with a control population, and its use of validated post-ICU outcome measures. ¬© 2023 Flaws et al.

Method: Using the six-step intervention mapping (IM) framework, this paper describes the development and content of the PharMIbridge pharmacist training programme, an integral part of the RCT implementation, and continuous adaptations made to the process to keep pace with the evolving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in Australia. A Training Working Group comprising health educators, practitioners, mental health consumers and researchers, refined the programme objectives and assisted with developing content and troubleshooting issues related to training delivery for pharmacists randomised to the RCT intervention arm. Results: A 2-day training programme was developed, which included Mental Health First Aid, simulated patient role-plays, and four pre-recorded modules using lectures, demonstration case vignettes, role-play activities and discussion. The programme, co-facilitated by project team members and mentors (pharmacist and consumer educators), aims to enhance pharmacists‚Äô mental health literacy, skills and confidence and empower them to engage with this vulnerable population using a strengths-based approach. Pre- and post-training questionnaires and interviews will be used to evaluate the impact of the PharMIbridge training programme. Conclusion: The systematic stepwise method provided by the IM framework highlights the solution-focused approach adopted by the project team and characteristics including adaptability and resilience which enabled training development and implementation across four Australian regions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. ¬© The Author(s) 2022.",10.1177/00178969221130461,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Healthcare Policy,This is a protocol / pre-analysis plan.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The description does not provide information on whether the study showed statistically significant results or

This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of an 8-week multi-strategy behavioral intervention that included vegetable provisioning and online menu architecture on vegetable sales in primary school canteens. A randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 16 Australian primary schools (n = 4302 students). The control arm kept their regular canteen menu. The primary outcome was vegetable sales measured by assessing vegetable content (in grams) from all menu items and using canteen sales (ordered online and over-the-counter) to calculate vegetable sales (in grams/week) at baseline (3 weeks) and during intervention implementation (8 weeks). Secondary outcomes were vegetable sales in subcategories, intervention acceptability among canteen managers and vegetable waste (four schools). Linear mixed model analysis showed that from baseline to follow-up, the intervention group had significantly higher weekly vegetable sales overall compared with the control group (2707 g/week, 95% CI 1276 to 4137 g/week; p < 0.001), with increased vegetable sales in the subcategories of burgers, hot foods and snacks, but not in sandwiches and pasta/rice dishes. The intervention did not lead to more vegetable waste, nor to a decrease in canteen revenue. The canteen managers found the intervention easy to implement and felt children responded favorably to three of the seven strategies. In conclusion, a multi-strategy behavioral canteen intervention increased vegetable sales amongst primary school students. ¬© 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/nu14194218,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Nutrition Policy,Full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,4302 students,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Pharmacists are trained in pharmacology and therapeutics, and therefore well placed to act as non-medical prescribers. Objectives: To assess the safety and accuracy of inpatient medication charts within a pharmacist collaborative prescribing model (intervention), compared to the usual medical model (control) in the emergency department (ED). Another objective compared venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment and prescribing, between intervention and control groups. Methods: Adult patients in ED referred for hospital admission were randomised into control or intervention by a block randomisation method, until the required sample size was reached. Medication charts were audited retrospectively by an independent auditor, using validated audit forms. Results: Intervention group medication charts contained significantly fewer prescribing errors, omissions and discrepancies compared to the control group, and improved documentation of adverse drug reactions. VTE risk assessment and prescribing had higher guideline concordance in the intervention group compared to the control group. Conclusions: This collaborative prescribing trial showed excellent results in safety and accuracy of pharmacist prescribing when compared to the usual medical model of prescribing. The admitting medical practitioner and extended scope pharmacist prescriber worked as a collaborative team in emergency, which improved Australian national prescribing safety indicators. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.sapharm.2022.05.005,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Healthcare Reform,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Scott J.E.T.; Mazzucchelli T.G.; Luszcz M.A.; Walker R.; Windsor T.D.,A behavioural activation intervention to increase engagement with life and wellbeing in older adults: Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,2022,"Background: Meaningful activity engagement is a critical element of ageing well. Interventions designed to increase activity engagement tend to be activity-specific and do not always meet the needs of older adults with diverse interests and capacities. Behavioural activation (BA) provides a promising person-centred framework for promoting engagement in valued activities. This study will examine the effectiveness of a behavioural activation-based intervention for promoting engagement with life and wellbeing among older adults. Method: Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two conditions (BA intervention, Active Control) and take part in a six-week intervention that consists of one-on-one weekly sessions of up to one hour to be administered either via telephone or online video conferencing with a trained facilitator. This study will recruit 120 + participants aged 65 + who score at or below the median on a test of life engagement. Participants will complete questionnaires of primary and secondary measures both pre-program, one-week and three months post-program. Participants will also complete a daily diary questionnaire during the fourth and fifth weeks of the intervention. The primary outcome measure is the Life Engagement Test, and secondary outcome measures include assessments of subjective wellbeing, psychological wellbeing, mental health, self-reported health, social engagement, loneliness and life satisfaction. Discussion: The outcomes from this study will provide evidence as to whether a BA based approach represents an effective method for promoting engagement with life and wellbeing among older community-dwelling adults.

Learning to Lead (L2L) is a student-led, primary schoolbased leadership program whereby older 'peer leaders' deliver a fundamental movement skills (FMS) program to younger 'peers' within their own school. Aim The aims of the study are to determine the efficacy of a peer-led FMS intervention on: (i) peer leaders' (aged 10 to 12 years) leadership effectiveness (primary outcome), leadership self-efficacy, well-being, and time on-task in the classroom; (ii) peers' (aged 8 to 10 years) physical activity levels, actual and perceived FMS competency, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular power, and executive functioning; and (iii) teachers' (referred to as 'school champions') work-related stress and well-being. Method L2L will be evaluated using a two-arm parallel group cluster randomised controlled trial. Twenty schools located within a two-hour drive of the University of Newcastle, Australia will be recruited. We will recruit 80 students (40 peer leaders and 40 peers) from each school (N = 1,600). L2L will be implemented in three phases: Phase 1 -school champions' training via a professional learning workshop; Phase 2 -school champions' delivery of leadership lessons to the peer leaders; and Phase 3 -peer leaders' delivery of the FMS program to their younger peers. The FMS program, consisting of 12 x 30-minute lessons, will be delivered over the course of one school term (10 weeks).

Gore J.; Rickards B.; Fray L.,From performative to professional accountability: re-imagining ‚Äòthe field of judgment‚Äô through teacher professional development,2023,"The rise of performative culture in education and intensifying forms of test-based accountability have subjected teachers to a ubiquitous ‚Äòfield of judgment‚Äô through which they are held to account. Within this context, professional development is consistently deployed as a key solution to stagnant or declining student outcomes. In this paper, we examine how accountability might be reimagined through one approach to professional development known as Quality Teaching Rounds (QTR). We draw on Foucault‚Äôs notion of panopticism and Ball‚Äôs influential writings on performativity to analyse interviews with 21 educators from 14 schools in New South Wales, Australia, conducted during a 2014‚Äì2015 randomised controlled trial. Participants highlighted the pervasiveness of testing and test results in shaping their experience of teaching in a system of perpetual surveillance where numbers bite deep into practice. By contrast, participation in QTR afforded teachers rare spaces of freedom within the structure of performativity to collaboratively focus on pedagogy. We argue meaningful professional development can alter the field of judgment and enable teachers to reclaim accountability on their own terms, while maintaining a clear focus on student outcomes. ¬© 2022 The Author(s).

Alexander K.; Humphreys C.; Wise S.; Zhou A.,Bringing Dignity to the Assessment of Safety for Children who Live with Violence,2022,"Fear dominates women and children‚Äôs experience of domestic violence. Fear of harm, and the consequences of others finding out, can mean mothers are reluctant to seek help. Ironically, these survival behaviours can be understood as non-protective by child protection practitioners. This article describes research undertaken in New South Wales (NSW) Australia to determine the impact on child protection practitioner perceptions of child safety when Response-Based Practice (RBP) questions are combined with the standard NSW Structured Decision Making (SDM) safety assessment. RBP reflects core social work values through questions that explore how victims respond to, resist and manage violence. A vignette experiment with a between-subjects design was used to compare child safety assessments by practitioners who watched an interview guided by SDM alone and practitioners who watched an interview using the combined ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô (SDM√æRBP) approach. Participants (N ¬º 1,041) were randomly assigned to SDM and treatment groups. Participants who watched the treatment approach were significantly more likely to assess the mother as cooperative and protective and significantly less likely to indicate that the children would be taken from her care. Thus, the results demonstrate that understanding how women manage violence changes practitioner views about maternal protectiveness and child safety. ¬© The Author(s) 2022.",10.1093/bjsw/bcab260,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Child Protection,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,A vignette experiment with a between-subjects design.,"1,041","Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Tian R.; Stojanovski E.; Miller D.,A novel application of multilevel SEM: Teaching quality as mediator between intervention and student achievement,2023,"Improving teaching quality has been an ongoing pursuit for policymakers, researchers and broader government agencies and organisations. Professional development (PD) initiatives directed at teachers are a recognised strategy for improving teaching quality, with the underlying intention to support improved student achievement. Yet there is limited evidence of the actual impact of PD directed at teachers on student learning outcomes. Quality Teaching Rounds (QTR), a well-recognised form of collaborative PD in Australia, is one of few approaches to provide evidence of impact on teaching quality and student outcomes. Through multiple Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), a statistically significant positive impact of QTR PD has been demonstrated on teaching practices and student outcomes. A further question that remains is whether the change in teaching quality through involvement in QTR PD improves student achievement. This underlying mechanism is yet to be explored in the QTR PD framework and has rarely been explored in PD settings internationally due to limited data that often prevents suitable statistical techniques to be employed. A clustered RCT investigating the impact of QTR PD on teaching quality and student achievement was conducted in 2019, involving 133 government primary schools in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Data were collected from 222 teachers and 5146 students in Stage 2 (years 3-4) in Term 1 and these teachers and students were followed up in Term 4 of the same year. Teaching practices were observed and rated in the classroom using a pedagogical model, the Quality Teaching (QT) model, which contains 18 observable elements within three dimensions of teaching practice (Intellectual Quality, Quality Learning Environment and Significance), while students were assessed using the Progressive Achievement Test (PAT) in mathematics, which was measured using the scaled scores on 40 multiple choice questions. The data structure therefore comprised a combination of multilevel and longitudinal features along with latent constructs and multiple intervention groups (QTR vs wait-list control) that were being compared. This paper examines the underlying interconnected relationships between PD, teaching quality and student achievement by testing the hypothesis that the impacts of the QTR intervention on student achievement in mathematics was mediated by teaching quality. Multilevel structural equation modelling (MSEM) with 2-2-1 design is investigated for these data. Student PAT scores in mathematics were significantly higher, on average (0.11SD [95% CI = 0.01,0.20]) in the intervention group (QTR) compared to those in the control group for the Intellectual Quality (IQ) dimension of the QT model. This demonstrates the statistically significant mediation effect of Intellectual Quality (IQ) on student learning outcomes. ¬© 2023 Proceedings of the International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM.

Feral cats have been implicated in causing declines and ongoing suppression of populations. Aims: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the response of small and medium-sized native mammal populations when cat predation was removed. Methods: A field experiment was conducted in a tropical savanna environment of northern Australia. Three experimental treatments were applied to six plots to compare and contrast responses of native mammals to predator exclusion and the additive effects of frequent fire. Plots were monitored regularly between 2013 and 2017. Key results: After 4 years of monitoring, no significant difference in capture rates of native mammals was detected between cat-accessible plots and those where they were excluded. Conclusions: There was no evidence of population recovery of native mammals in response to predator exclusion. There was some evidence that frequent burning, independent of cat exclusion, adversely affects native mammal diversity. Implications: Although predation by feral cats is a major threat to small and medium-sized native mammals, disturbance from fire, and grazing by introduced herbivores, have been shown to significantly impede native mammal population recovery in tropical savanna ecosystems. Management programs that solely focus on suppressing feral cat populations may be inadequate in ameliorating ongoing mammal declines in landscapes with other significant disturbance regimes.  ¬© 2022 CSIRO.",10.1071/WR21073,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Wildlife Conservation,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,The sample size is not explicitly given.,The study did not show statistically significant results.

This cluster randomised controlled trial aimed to test the effectiveness of a menu audit and feedback strategy alone, and in combination with online menu labels in encouraging healthier purchasing from an online school canteen ordering system. Five intervention schools received a menu audit and feedback strategy, plus online menu labels; and five control schools received a delayed menu audit and feedback strategy. Data from 19,799 student lunch orders, containing over 40,000 items were included in the evaluation. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (pre-intervention), follow-up 1 (menu audit and feedback vs control), and follow-up 2 (menu audit and feedback plus online menu labels vs menu audit and feedback alone). From baseline to follow-up 1, the menu audit and feedback strategy alone had no significant effect on the proportion of healthy (‚ÄòEveryday‚Äô) and less healthy (‚ÄòOccasional‚Äô or ‚ÄòShould not be sold‚Äô) items purchased. From baseline to follow-up 2, schools that received menu audit and feedback plus online menu labels had significantly higher odds of students purchasing ‚ÄòEveryday‚Äô items (OR: 1.19; p = 0.019), and significantly lower odds of students purchasing ‚ÄòOccasional‚Äô (OR: 0.86; p = 0.048) and ‚ÄòShould not be sold‚Äô (OR: 0.52; p < 0.001) items.

Moore B.; Woodcock S.; Dudley D.,Well-being warriors: A randomized controlled trial examining the effects of martial arts training on secondary students‚Äô resilience,2021,"Background: Mental health problems are a growing and significant issue in the Australian education system. Research has suggested that resilience can be learned and that schools can play an important role in developing resilient skills among youth; however, rigorous evaluation of interventions promoting resilience is limited. Aims: As martial arts training has been found to have psychological benefits such as increased confidence and self-esteem, this study investigated whether a 10-week martial arts training programme was an efficacious sports-based mental health intervention that promoted resilience in secondary school students. Sample: Two hundred and eighty-three secondary school students (age range 12‚Äì14¬†years) participated in the study. Methods: The study examined the effects of martial arts training on participants‚Äô resilience by delivering a 10-week martial arts-based intervention in secondary school settings. The intervention was evaluated using quantitative methodology and an experimental research design using a randomized controlled trial which measured participant responses at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. Results: The study found that the martial arts-based intervention had a significantly positive effect on developing students‚Äô resilience. This was especially apparent when the intervention and control group‚Äôs mean resilience outcomes were compared. Resilience outcomes appeared to be stronger immediately following the intervention compared with 12-week follow-up. Conclusions: Given the prevalence of mental illness among Australian youth, the current study provides robust evidence that students‚Äô resilience can be improved using martial arts-based interventions delivered in school settings.

Gore J.; Rosser B.,Beyond content-focused professional development: powerful professional learning through genuine learning communities across grades and subjects,2022,"Articulations of effective teacher professional development (PD) consistently foreground a focus on curriculum content and how best to teach it. Consequently, when teachers work together on pedagogy they typically work with colleagues who have similar specialisations, focusing on a specific subject or part of the curriculum. Arguably, however, pedagogical practices cut across grades and subjects, which signals the possibility of effective PD that includes diverse teachers. In this paper, we analyse the impact of a pedagogy-focused approach to PD called Quality Teaching Rounds (QTR), recently tested under randomised controlled trial conditions. Drawing on post-intervention interviews with 96 teachers and leaders at 24 schools in NSW, Australia, we demonstrate that QTR generated fresh insights about pedagogy and students, enhanced collegiality and led to ongoing professional collaboration, even though it does not abide by the general consensus that effective PD should be content-focused. We argue that pedagogy-focused PD, using QTR, is an important mechanism for improving teaching on a large scale, not just for this grade or subject, but for teaching in general. With a global push for better teaching as foundational to improved student outcomes, building teaching capacity across the entire teacher workforce remains a challenge. QTR offers a way forward. ¬© 2020 The Author(s).

The primary aim of this study is to assess whether an enhanced implementation intervention increases adoption of the PAX Good Behaviour Game in New South Wales (NSW) primary schools in Australia. A secondary outcome is to investigate the impact of the PAX Good Behaviour Game on children's mental health in the Australian context. Methods and analysis: The study uses a cluster randomised hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation design and will involve 40 NSW primary schools. Randomisation will occur at the school level. All NSW primary schools trained in the PAX Good Behaviour Game are eligible for participation. The intervention is a multicomponent implementation strategy that has been iteratively co-designed by our research team and local stakeholders. Intervention schools will have access to eight implementation support strategies in addition to the training received as usual delivery to build knowledge and skills. Research staff will assess implementation and effectiveness outcomes using self-report online surveys with teachers and support staff at baseline, 6-weeks, 6-months and 12-months follow up. Semi-structured interviews with teachers and support staff will be used to examine which implementation strategies worked for whom and under what conditions. Discussion: If successful, this study will highlight effective strategies schools or education departments can use internationally to improve their translation of evidence-based programs into routine practices. This will lead to better outcomes for children and young people. ¬© 2022 The Authors",10.1016/j.conctc.2022.100923,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Education Policy,This is a protocol / pre-analysis plan.,Field experiment,A cluster randomised hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation design,40,"The description provided is a study protocol, which outlines the planned methods and objectives"
Sexton E.T.S.; Sheehan J.; Van Dam N.T.; Grobler A.; Phillips L.; Yaari M.; Hiscock H.,Feasibility of the Early Minds Program by Smiling Mind: a Pilot Cluster-Randomized-Controlled Trial,2022,"Objectives: While there is increasing interest in mindfulness-informed programs to support preschooler social, emotional, and cognitive development, evaluation of feasibility and efficacy is required prior to implementing such programs within the early education setting. This study evaluated the feasibility of an 8-week, app-based, educator-delivered, mindfulness-informed program, Early Minds by Smiling Mind. An established framework was used to assess demand, acceptability, implementation, practicality, (adequate) adaptation, integration, and limited efficacy testing. Limited efficacy testing explored program use on preschoolers‚Äô internalizing, externalizing, prosocial behaviors, and executive function. Methods: A pilot cluster-randomized-controlled trial (CRCT) was conducted with 25 early learning educators and 188 preschoolers from six early learning centres (ELCs) in Melbourne, Australia. Post baseline data collection, ELC rooms were randomly allocated to the program (n = 5 rooms, 111 children) or usual care (n = 5 rooms, 77 children) group. Data was collected at baseline, 3-month, and 12-month post-randomization. Results: The Early Minds program did not meet feasibility on four of the seven educator-reported domains (implementation, practicality, adaptation, and limited efficacy testing) and showed mixed results for two of the seven domains (acceptability and integration). Parent-reported feasibility has not been established as too few parents used the program. Educators provided rich feedback and specific suggestions to improve the program content to be more suitable and engaging for the preschool context and to work within the challenges of the early education setting. Conclusions: The Early Minds program requires modification to address educator needs and improve child suitability and engagement. Following modification, re-assessment of feasibility is required. ¬© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s12671-021-01804-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Education Policy,Full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,188,"The study did not show statistically significant results in terms of feasibility, as the"
Guillen P.; Kesten O.; Kiefer A.; Melatos M.,A field evaluation of a matching mechanism: University applicant behavior in Australia,2022,"The majority of undergraduate university applications in the state of New South Wales‚ÄîAustralia‚Äôs largest state‚Äîare processed by a clearinghouse, the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC). Applicants submit an ordered list of degrees to the UAC, which applies a matching algorithm to allocate university places to eligible applicants. Applicants receive advice on how to construct their degree preference list from multiple sources including individual universities. This advice is often confusing and misleading. To evaluate the performance of the current system, we run a large sample (832 observations) online experiment with experienced participants in a choice environment that mimics the UAC application process, and in which truth telling is optimal. We vary the advice received across treatments: no advice, the UAC advice only, an instance of misleading university advice only, and both the UAC and the misleading university advice together. Overall, 75.5% of participants fail to behave in their best interest. High rates of applicant manipulation persist even when applicants are provided with the UAC‚Äôs accurate advice. Students who attend nonselective government high schools are more prone to use strictly dominated strategies than those who attend academically selective government high schools and private high schools. ¬©C The Author(s) 2022.",10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac010,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Education Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Something else,832,The description does not provide specific information on whether the study showed statistically significant results
Uddin M.; Wang L.C.; Smyth R.,Do government-initiated energy comparison sites encourage consumer search and lower prices? Evidence from an online randomized controlled experiment in Australia,2021,"We conduct an online randomized controlled experiment in Australia in order to examine whether government initiatives to encourage the use of energy comparison sites increase consumer search and result in lower prices. Despite significant price variations across energy retailers, our experiment indicates that while providing information about the potential gains from using the government-owned Victoria Energy Compare (VEC) website encourages participants to visit the website, it is not effective in inducing them to contact, or switch, retailers who are providing better offers. Moreover, low-income individuals who visited the VEC website due to the availability of a $50 bonus are less likely to contact retailers for a better deal in order to switch retailers, and end up paying a higher cost of per unit kWh electricity and spending more on total electricity expenditure. Our findings imply that promoting government-initiated comparison sites is not sufficient to increase competition and that providing consumers with financial incentives for using these sites in order to encourage competition and improve outcomes of the energy poor may potentially backfire. ¬© 2021",10.1016/j.jebo.2021.05.016,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Energy Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Online randomized controlled experiment,The sample size is not given.,The study did not show statistically significant results in terms of encouraging participants to contact
McGill N.; McLeod S.; Ivory N.; Davis E.; Rohr K.,Randomised Controlled Trial Evaluating Active versus Passive Waiting for Speech-Language Pathology,2021,"Introduction: High demand for speech-language pathology means children sometimes wait over 12 months for services, missing out on timely support. Waiting can be a time of stress, concern, and powerlessness for caregivers. Provision of information via a website may support families and encourage active waiting. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare children's speech, intelligibility, language, and literacy outcomes, and caregivers' satisfaction and empowerment in active versus passive waiting conditions. Methods: Ninety-seven preschool-aged children referred to a community health speech-language pathology service in Australia were screened for eligibility. Eligible children (n =42) with speech/language difficulties were randomly allocated to: (a) active waiting (provision of a purpose-built website; n = 20), or (b) passive waiting (control group; n = 22). Pre- and post-assessments (after 6 months on a waiting list) were completed with children and caregivers by a speech-language pathologist blinded to group allocations. Results: Intention to treat (n =36) and per-protocol analyses (n =30) were conducted to measure group differences in child and caregiver outcomes at post-assessment using one-way ANCOVA, controlling for baseline scores. There were no statistically significant differences between groups for children's speech, intelligibility, language, and literacy, or caregivers' empowerment and satisfaction. Children in both groups made minimal gains over 6 months. Conclusions: Provision of an active waiting website did not lead to statistically significant change in child or caregiver outcomes, and children in both groups made little progress over a 6-month period. Early speech-language pathology intervention delivered with appropriate dosage is needed to optimise children's outcomes. Until timely and effective speech-language pathology intervention can be provided for all who need it, provision of early assessments may be beneficial. There remains a need for effective ways to support children and families on waiting lists.  ¬© 2020 ",10.1159/000508830,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Healthcare Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,42,The study did not show statistically significant results.

Whelan J.; Marshall H.; Sullivan T.R.,Intracluster correlation coefficients in a large cluster randomized vaccine trial in schools: Transmission and impact of shared characteristics,2021,"Cluster randomized trials (cRCT) to assess vaccine effectiveness incorporate indirect effects of vaccination, helping to inform vaccination policy. To calculate the sample size for a cRCT, an estimate of the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) is required. For infectious diseases, shared characteristics and social mixing behaviours may increase susceptibility and exposure, promote transmission and be a source of clustering. We present ICCs from a school-based cRCT assessing the effectiveness of a meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero, GlaxoSmithKline) on reducing oropharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) in 34,489 adolescents from 237 schools in South Australia in 2017/2018. We also explore the contribution of shared behaviours and characteristics to these ICCs. The ICC for carriage of disease-causing Nm genogroups (primary outcome) pre-vaccination was 0.004 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.007) and for all Nm was 0.007 (95%CI: 0.004, 0.011). Adjustment for social behaviours and personal characteristics reduced the ICC for carriage of disease-causing and all Nm genogroups by 25% (to 0.003) and 43% (to 0.004), respectively. ICCs are also reported for risk factors here, which may be outcomes in future research. Higher ICCs were observed for susceptibility and/or exposure variables related to Nm carriage (having a cold, spending ‚â•1 night out socializing or kissing ‚â•1 person in the previous week). In metropolitan areas, nights out socializing was a highly correlated behaviour. By contrast, smoking was a highly correlated behaviour in rural areas. A practical example to inform future cRCT sample size estimates is provided. ¬© 2021 Whelan et al.

Objectives: A model of care based on Atraumatic Restorative Treatment and the Hall Technique (ART-HT) to manage ECC was evaluated among remote Aboriginal communities in Australia. Methods: Aboriginal communities in the North-West of Western Australia were invited to participate and consenting communities were randomized into early or delayed intervention for the management of ECC. Children were examined at baseline and at the 11-mo follow-up. The early intervention group (test) was provided with the ART-based dental care at baseline while the delayed intervention group (control) was advised to seek care through the usual care options available within the community. At follow-up, both groups were examined by calibrated examiners, and were offered care using the ART-HT approach. Changes from baseline to follow-up in caries experience were tested using paired tests. Multivariate analysis after multiple imputation of missing data used generalised estimating equation (GEE) controlling for clustering within communities. Results: A total of 25 communities and 338 children (mean age = 3.6 y, SD 1.7) participated in the study (test = 177). At follow-up, 231 children were examined (68% retention, test = 125). At follow-up, children in the test group had more filled teeth (test filled teeth = 1.2, control filled teeth = 0.2, P < 0.001) and decreased levels of decayed teeth (mean test = 0.7 fewer teeth with decay, mean control = 1.0 more tooth with decay, P < 0.001). GEE analysis controlled for baseline caries experience, age, sex, and community water fluoride levels found increased rates of untreated decayed teeth (RR = 1.4, P = 0.02) and decreased rates of filled teeth (RR = 0.2, P < 0.001) at follow-up among the control group. Conclusion: A model of care relying on the principles of minimally invasive atraumatic approaches enabled the delivery of effective dental services to young children (<6 y) in remote Aboriginal Australian communities resulting in increased levels of care and improved oral health. Knowledge Transfer Statement: This cluster-randomized trial tested a multi-component model of dental care to young children with ECC in remote Aboriginal communities in Australia. The intervention, based on the atraumatic approaches using minimally invasive techniques encompassing preventive care, Atraumatic Restorative Treatment and the Hall Technique (ART-HT), delivered more restorative care and reduced the incidence of caries. This model of care was more effective than available standard care and should be incorporated into mainstream service delivery programs. ¬© International & American Associations for Dental Research 2020.",10.1177/2380084420963949,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Healthcare Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,338,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Haynes A.; Sherrington C.; Wallbank G.; Wickham J.; Tong A.; Kirkham C.; Manning S.; Ramsay E.; Tiedemann A.,Using self-determination theory to understand and improve recruitment for the Coaching for Healthy Ageing (CHAnGE) trial,2021,"Background Intervention trials promoting physical activity among older people frequently report low and unrepresentative recruitment. Better understanding of reasons for participation can help improve recruitment. This study explored why participants enrolled in the Coaching for Healthy Ageing (CHAnGE) trial, including how their decision was influenced by recruitment strategies. CHAnGE was a cluster randomised controlled trial testing the effectiveness of a healthy ageing program targeting inactivity and falls. Seventy-two groups of people aged 60 + were recruited from community organisations via informal presentations by the health coaches. Methods We conducted a secondary thematic analysis of interview data from our wider qualitative evaluation in which 32 purposively sampled trial participants took part in semi-structured interviews about their experiences of CHAnGE. Data relating to recruitment and participation were analysed inductively to identify themes, then a coding framework comprising the core constructs from self-determination theory‚Äîautonomy, competence and relatedness‚Äîwas used to explore if and how this theory fit with and helped to explain our data. Results Recruitment presentations promoted the CHAnGE intervention well in terms of addressing value expectations of structured support, different forms of accountability, credibility, achievability and, for some, a potential to enhance social relationships. Participation was motivated by the desire for improved health and decelerated ageing, altruism and curiosity. These factors related strongly to self-determination concepts of autonomy, competence and relatedness, but the intervention‚Äôs demonstrated potential to support self-determination needs could be conveyed more effectively. Conclusions Findings suggest that recruitment could have greater reach using: 1. Strengths-based messaging focusing on holistic gains, 2. Participant stories that highlight positive experiences, and 3. Peer support and information sharing to leverage altruism and curiosity. These theory-informed improvements will be used to increase participation in future trials, including people in hard-to-recruit groups. They may also inform other physical activity trials and community programs. Copyright: ¬© 2021 Haynes et al.

This study aimed to test the efficacy of SoMe, a social media literacy body image, dieting, and wellbeing program for adolescents, through a cluster randomized controlled trial. Participants (n = 892; Mage = 12.77, SD = 0.74; range 11‚Äì15; 49.5% male) were randomized by school (n = 8) to receive either weekly SoMe (n = 483) or control sessions (lessons as usual; n = 409) over 4 weeks in their classroom. Participants completed surveys at four timepoints (baseline, 1-week post-intervention, and 6-and 12-month follow-up) assessing body dissatisfaction, dietary restraint, strategies to increase muscles (primary outcomes), self-esteem and depressive symptoms (secondary outcomes), and internalization of appearance ideals and appearance comparison (exploratory outcomes). Modest positive intervention effects were found in dietary restraint and depressive symptoms at 6-month follow-up in girls but few positive effects emerged for boys. The findings provide only preliminary support for a social media literacy intervention, but suggest the usefulness of both identifying those who benefit most from a universally delivered intervention and the need to refine the intervention to maximize intervention effects. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

The study aim was to determine the effect of providing tailored feedback on the healthiness of students‚Äô lunch orders from a school canteen online ordering system. A cluster randomized controlled trial with ten government primary schools in New South Wales, Australia was conducted. Consenting schools that used an online canteen provider (‚ÄòFlexischools‚Äô) were randomized to either: a graph and prompt showing the proportion of ‚Äòeveryday‚Äô foods selected or a standard online ordering system. Students with an online lunch order during baseline data collection were included (n = 2200 students; n = 7604 orders). Primary outcomes were the proportion of foods classified as ‚Äòeveryday‚Äô or ‚Äòcaution‚Äô. Secondary outcomes included: mean energy, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium content. There was no difference over time between groups on the proportion of ‚Äòeveryday‚Äô (OR 0.99; p = 0.88) or ‚Äòcaution‚Äô items purchased (OR 1.17; p = 0.45). There was a significant difference between groups for average energy content (mean difference 51 kJ; p‚àí0.02), with both groups decreasing. There was no difference in the saturated fat, sugar, or sodium content. Tailored feedback did not impact the proportion of ‚Äòeveryday‚Äô or ‚Äòcaution‚Äô foods or the nutritional quality of online canteen orders.

However, few intervention trials have investigated how recreational infrastructure can be used to reduce inactivity levels in communities. The MOVE Frankston study aimed to assess the impact of low intensity strategies to promote use of a multi-purpose leisure and aquatic centre in a socioeconomically diverse, metropolitan community. This randomised controlled trial of two years‚Äô duration compared public awareness raising (control condition) with two interventions: mailed information about the centre and a free entry pass (I-O); and this minimal intervention supplemented by customer relations management support through telephone contact, mailed promotional materials and additional incentives (I+S). Participants (n = 1320) were inactive adults living in the City of Frankston, Melbourne Australia. There were 928 people (70.3%) followed up at 12 months (61.2% female, 52% ‚â•55 yrs). Compared with controls, attendance at the Centre once or more was higher in both the I-O (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.28‚Äì2.50) and I+S groups (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.03‚Äì2.07). The proportion of people using the centre weekly did not differ by group. The odds of being in contemplation or preparation to use the Centre were higher in both the I-O (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.28‚Äì2.42) and I+S groups (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.07‚Äì2.06). Total physical activity and related social and cognitive factors did not differ between the groups. The findings show that the low intensity promotional strategies prompted occasional attendance and increased readiness to use this recreational facility, a level of behaviour change unlikely to reduce non-communicable disease risk. It is recommended that more frequent customer relations contact, and involvement of healthcare providers, be tested as strategies to encourage inactive adults to take up physical activity opportunities at recreational facilities of this type. ¬© 2021 Smith et al.

The aim of this study is to examine whether an online interdisciplinary intervention that incorporates evidence-based strategies from the disciplines of Lifestyle Medicine and Positive Psychology improves measures of mental health and emotional wellness. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with a wait-list control (N = 425, aged 46.97 ¬± 14.5, 69.9% females) was conducted in Australia and New Zealand.

Participants were randomly allocated to view images of models presented in either an active or posed stance, or images of scenery. Participants completed pre- and post-test measures of appearance and functionality satisfaction, as well as trait measures of body appreciation and satisfaction. Results showed that women had poorer outcomes after viewing the active but not the posed or scenery images. Neither body appreciation nor body satisfaction moderated effects.

Siu A.H.Y.; Krass I.; Mitchell B.; McNamara K.,Implementation of diabetes screening in community pharmacy ‚Äì factors influencing successful implementation,2021,"Introduction: Community pharmacists are increasingly providing a range of professional health services. Whilst research provides evidence of their benefits, knowledge translation into practice has been challenging both in Australia and internationally. An opportunity to develop a granular understanding of factors driving successful implementation was presented by the Pharmacy Diabetes Screening Trial (PDST), a clustered Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) implemented in a random sample of 339 Australian community pharmacies. Its aim was to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of three pharmacy-based diabetes screening interventions. Objective: To investigate the experiences of Australian community pharmacists in the implementation of the PDST and factors influencing implementation success. Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with a stratified sample of pharmacist trial participants based on screening performance (number screened relative to target), location, and trial arm. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed ad verbatim. Interviews were continued until saturation. Initial thematic analysis was followed by in-depth analysis to test the extent to which the data fitted with three previously described overarching themes driving successful national implementation of innovation in community pharmacy. Results: From August 2017 to October 2017, 21 interviews were conducted; 12 with high-performing and 9 with low-performing pharmacists. The key enablers and barriers were qualities of a pharmacy champion and active staff engagement, ease of implementation related to the number of working pharmacists and other staff, the external context including engagement with consumers and doctors, and consumer demand. It was also identified that attitudes/emphasis towards implementation planning and conscious prioritisation of service delivery by pharmacists may have been key differences between high- and low-performing pharmacies. Conclusion: Insights into the interaction between individual, organisational, and external factors influencing successful implementation of community pharmacy innovations highlighted in this study should inform the design of future innovations to ensure their success and sustainability. ¬© 2020",10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.12.013,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Healthcare Policy,This is a full study with results.,Something else,A clustered RCT,339,The description does not provide specific information about statistically significant results or detailed outcomes of
Clare J.; Henstock D.; McComb C.; Newland R.; Barnes G.C.,The results of a randomized controlled trial of police body-worn video in Australia,2021,"Objectives: We report the results of a randomized controlled trial of police body-worn video (BWV) cameras in an Australian context, with a focus on how cameras influence evidence gathering, court processes/outcomes, and police/public behavior. Methods: The 6-month trial undertaken by the Western Australia Police Force involved a sample of officers (N = 498) acting as their own controls with camera use (‚Äútreatment‚Äù) randomly allocated across shifts. A range of parametric and non-parametric tests were conducted to explore the influence of BWV on interview efficiency, rate/timing of guilty pleas, conviction rates, sanction rates, police use-of-force, assaults against police, and citizen complaints against police. Results: The trial generated mixed results in support of this technology within this Australian context. BWV recordings did result in evidence-gathering benefits by producing cost/time efficiencies when taking field interviews. BWV footage had limited impact on court processes/outcomes, with indication that camera evidence encouraged earlier guilty pleas but no corresponding increase in the rate of guilty pleas or convictions. BWV did influence police operational decision-making, with increased sanction rates and use-of-force on treatment days. The extent to which officers engaged with the trial compounded these patterns. There was no evidence that BWV prevents problem behavior, with citizens‚Äô complaints increasing on treatment days and no influence of BWV on rates of assaults against police. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for additional context-specific clarity about why police use BWV cameras. In particular, BWV users should clearly specify the causal mechanisms through which cameras will achieve administrative, evidentiary, operational, and/or problem-prevention goals. ¬© 2019, The Author(s).",10.1007/s11292-019-09387-w,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Law Enforcement,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,498,The study showed mixed results regarding the impact of police body-worn video (

Design/methodology/approach: This study sought to recruit 824 ex-smokers from 2 smoke-free prisons in the Northern Territory, Australia. Participants were randomised to receive either one session (45‚Äì60 min) face-to-face MI intervention 4‚Äì6 weeks prior to release or usual care (UC) without smoking advice. The primary outcome was continuous smoking abstinence verified by exhaled carbon monoxide test (<5 ppm) at three months post-release. Secondary outcomes included seven-day point-prevalence, time to the first cigarette and the daily number of cigarettes smoked after release. Findings: From April 2017 to March 2018, a total of 557 participants were randomised to receive the MI (n = 266) or UC (n = 291), with 75% and 77% being followed up, respectively. There was no significant between-group difference in continuous abstinence (MI 8.6% vs UC 7.4%, risk ratio = 1.16, 95%CI 0.67‚àº2.03). Of all participants, 66.9% relapsed on the day of release and 90.2% relapsed within three months. On average, participants in the MI group smoked one less cigarette daily than those in the UC within the three months after release (p < 0.01). Research limitations/implications: A single-session of MI is insufficient to reduce relapse after release from a smoke-free prison. However, prison release remains an appealing time window to build on the public health benefit of smoke-free prisons. Further research is needed to develop both pre- and post-release interventions that provide continuity of care for relapse prevention. Originality/value: This study is the first Australian randomised controlled trial to evaluate a pre-release MI intervention on smoking relapse prevention amongst people released from smoke-free prisons. ¬© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/IJPH-01-2020-0003,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Public Health,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,824,The study did not show statistically significant results in continuous smoking abstinence between the

In many countries, including Australia, physical activity (i.e. physical education and school sport) is not mandatory in the final two¬†years of high school (i.e. senior school years). The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a time-efficient physical activity intervention on senior school students‚Äô on-task behaviour and subjective vitality. This was a sub-study of the Burn 2 Learn (B2L) cluster randomised controlled trial, which included two cohorts. Participants for this sub-study (N = 221) were from 10 secondary schools (23 classes) located in New South Wales, Australia (Cohort 2). Teachers allocated to the B2L intervention group were provided with training, resources and support to facilitate the delivery of two high-intensity activity breaks per week during lesson time for five¬†weeks. A wait-list control was used as comparison group. On-task behaviour was assessed at baseline and post-test, using a momentary time sampling procedure and expressed as a percentage of lesson time. At post-test, subjective vitality was assessed at the start and end of the lesson using a validated questionnaire. Significant group-by-time effects were observed for students‚Äô on-task behaviour in favour of the B2L group [adjusted mean difference = 19.3% of lesson time (95% CI, 0.8 to 37.8), p = 0.042, d = 0.43].

Teacher acceptability is important for uptake; however, process evaluations are scarce. This study evaluated the effect of two intensities of teacher training on the evaluation of a vegetable education program for Australian primary schools by teachers. The teachers (n = 65) who implemented the program as part of a cluster RCT (25 schools in two states, New South Wales and South Australia) received either low-(provision with materials and online training) or high (additional face-to-face (F2F) training)-intensity training prior to implementing a 5-week vegetable education program. They evaluated the acceptability of a digital training module and program by indicating the level of agreement with 15 and 18 statements, respectively, using 5-point Likert scales. The average item scores ranged from 3.0 to 4.2. All but one item, including student engagement, alignment to the curriculum and intent for reuse of the program, had a rounded average or median score of 4. The level of training intensity did not impact the teacher acceptability ratings. In conclusion, the teacher acceptability was good, and additional F2F training does not add value above the solely digital training of the teachers. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

Wilson W.J.; Harper-Hill K.; Armstrong R.; Downing C.; Perrykkad K.; Rafter M.; Ashburner J.,A preliminary investigation of sound-field amplification as an inclusive classroom adjustment for children with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder,2021,"Purpose: This study aimed to determine if sound-field amplification (SFA) could be used as an inclusive classroom adjustment to support primary school students with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Methods: A two-group, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with crossover was conducted involving 13 students with ASD (9 males, aged 7.6 to 8.4 years) and 17 typically progressing students without ASD (7 males, aged 7.6 to 9.3 years) from 10 primary schools in and near to Brisbane, Australia. Eighteen of these children had an SFA system in their classrooms in semester one and 12 in semester two of their fourth year of formal schooling (Year 3). Potential proximate benefits were assessed using teacher questionnaire and video analysis of student listening behaviours. Potential distant benefits were assessed using measures of phonological processing in quiet and in noise, attention, memory, and educational achievement. Results: Potential proximate benefits were observed for all students with teachers rating student listening behaviours higher with SFA versus without SFA. Potential distant benefits were observed for students with ASD who showed greater improvements in one area of phonological processing (blending nonsense words in noise) following SFA versus no SFA. No other potential proximate or distant benefits following SFA were observed. Conclusions: SFA could be used as an inclusive classroom adjustment to support some primary school students with and without ASD by potentially putting those students in a better position to learn, but their learning must still take place over time and realistic expectations of what can reasonably be achieved by SFA alone are needed. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.jcomdis.2021.106142,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Education Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,"A two-group, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with crossover.",30,The study did not show statistically significant results for most measures.

Adult male prisoners were recruited for a 16-week randomised control trial comparing the effect of ingestion of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) and multivitamin supplements versus placebo on aggressive behaviour. The baseline and post-intervention assessments from the participant blood samples were the erythrocyte n-3 LCPUFA levels as well as measures of aggressive behaviour determined through institutional records of misconduct (IRM), the Inmate Behaviour Observation Scale (IBOS), and questionnaires. A total of 136 adult male prisoners consented to the study with a retention rate of 60%, and 93% of blood samples were successfully collected. The IRM and IBOS scores were collected for 100% of participants, whilst 82‚Äì97% of participants completed the questionnaires. From the baseline data, the Odds Ratio shows that prisoners are 4.3 times more likely to have an IBOS >2 if they are below the 6% cut off on the omega-3 index. Both groups improved across all outcome measures and, at the current sample size, no significant differences were seen between them. A power calculation suggests a total sample size of 600 participants is required to detect the effects of this dietary supplementation, and that this supplementation study is feasible in a Correctional Centre.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a Vegetable Education Resource To Increase Children‚Äôs Acceptance and Liking (VERTICAL) for Australian primary schools (curriculum aligned and based on a framework of food preference development and sensory experiential learning) on positively influencing factors predisposing children towards increased vegetable consumption. The secondary aim was to evaluate two levels of teacher training intensity on intervention effectiveness.

Pre-test, post-test and 3-month follow-up measures (knowledge, verbalization ability, vegetable acceptance, behavioural intentions, willing to taste, new vegetables consumed) were collected from students (n = 1639 from 25 schools in Sydney/Adelaide, Australia). Data were analyzed using mixed model analysis. No difference in intervention effectiveness was found between the two training methods. Compared to the Control, VERTICAL positively affected all outcome measures after intervention (p < 0.01) with knowledge sustained at 3-month follow-up (p < 0.001).

A Closer Look at the Peers of a Peer-Mediated Intervention to Improve Play in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,2020,"Peer-mediated interventions (PMIs) are often used to support children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to develop social skills. However, more investigation is needed to better understand the role of peers as both intervention recipients and models. Sixty-five typically developing peers who participated in a PMI for children with ASD were investigated using a randomised control trial. Play sessions of the dyads were scored using the Test of Playfulness. Results showed a significant moderate intervention effect for the peers from pre- to post-intervention; outcomes for children with ASD were not influenced by peer characteristics; and, the children demonstrated a similar pattern of play interaction.

By increasing knowledge and skills, peers may act as gatekeepers to mental health services. The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of a brief sports-based mental health literacy program to increase competencies and intentions to both provide and seek help for mental health problems among adolescent male sports participants. A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted with measures taken at 3 time points: baseline (2 weeks prior to intervention), immediately postintervention, and at 1-month follow-up. Adolescents were randomized to either the intervention group (n = 47) or a waitlist control group (n = 55) at a team level (n teams = 9). Participants were 102 male adolescents 12‚Äì18 years of age (M = 14.30, SD = 1.75) from a community football club in New South Wales, Australia. A 45-min Help Out a Mate (HOAM) workshop was delivered around a usual team practice session. Compared to the waitlist control, participants in the HOAM condition reported significant increases in knowledge of signs and symptoms of mental illness, intentions to provide help to a friend who may be experiencing a mental health problem, and attitudes that promote problem recognition and help-seeking. There were no between-group differences in confidence to provide help, personal help-seeking intentions, and psychological distress. The results suggest that a brief intervention can be effective at improving the mental health literacy of young men when delivered within a sports context. Lay summary: Compared to a waitlist control, the Help Out a Mate group showed improvements in mental health literacy for depression and anxiety and intentions to provide help along with sustained improvements in attitudes that promote help-seeking and reduce stigma.

Interventions that reduce these harms could avert significant suffering and healthcare costs. Objectives: The Discharge Medications Reconciliation (DCMedsRec) trial will evaluate a structured medication reconciliation service by community pharmacists post hospital discharge on the risk of 30-day unplanned readmission. Electronic access to the Hospital Discharge Summary via My Health Record will underpin this service. Methods: DCMedsRec is a non-blinded randomised controlled trial of an intervention by community pharmacists within 30 days of hospital discharge in Melbourne, Australia. Patients discharged from hospital will be assessed by a hospital pharmacist for trial eligibility. If eligible, patients will be randomised to either a control or intervention group by sequentially marked sealed envelopes. Intervention patients receive an invitation to the DCMedsRec service at a participating community pharmacy, who will be reimbursed. Control patients will receive usual care. A Number Needed to Treat of 20 will require 293 DCMedsRec interventions to achieve 80% power. With a predicted 30% uptake, a minimum sample of 977 in the intervention arm is required. Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the rate of 30-day unplanned hospital readmission in intervention (DCMedsRec) versus usual care groups. Secondary analyses will evaluate the economic impact of the intervention and a qualitative thematic analysis of the experience and value of the service for both patients and service providers (community pharmacists). Analysis: An intention-to-treat analysis will be used to assess intervention efficacy and results will be reported using risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Cost-effectiveness analysis will compare within-trial costs and outcomes of the DCMedsRec versus usual care from a health-system perspective.

Dollard M.F.; Bailey T.,Building Psychosocial Safety Climate in Turbulent Times: The Case of COVID-19,2021,"Our theoretically driven cluster-randomized cohort control study sought to understand how psychosocial safety climate (PSC)‚Äîa climate to protect worker psychological health‚Äîcould be built in different organizational change scenarios. We drew on event system theory to characterize change (planned vs. shock) as an event (observable, bounded in time and space, nonroutine) to understand how events connect and impact organizational behavior and features (e.g., job design, PSC). Event 1 was an 8-month planned intervention involving training middle managers to enact PSC in work units and reduce job stressors. Event 2 was the shock COVID-19 pandemic which occurred midintervention (at 4 months). Three waves (T1, 0 months; T2, 4 months; T3, 8 months) of data were collected from experimental (295T1, 224T2, 119T3) and control (236T1, 138T2, 83T3) employees across 22 work groups. Multilevel analysis showed in Event 1 (T1T2) a significant Group √ó Time effect where PSC (particularly management priority) significantly increased in the experimental versus control group. Under Event 2 (T2T3), PSC was maintained at higher levels in the experimental versus control group but both groups reported significantly increased PSC communication and commitment. Results suggest that middle management training increases PSC within 4 months. Event 2, COVID-19 was shocking and its novelty, disruption, criticality, and timing in Australian industrial history enabled a strong top management response, positively affecting the control group. PSC may be sustained and built in times of shock with top management will, the application of PSC principles, and a top-level pro-psychological health agenda. ¬© 2021 American Psychological Association",10.1037/apl0000939,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Workplace Safety,Full study with results.,Field experiment,Cluster-randomized cohort control study,"295T1, 224T2, 119T3 for the experimental group and 236T1, 138T2, 83","Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Dixon H.; Scully M.; Wakefield M.; Kelly B.; Pettigrew S.; Chapman K.; Niederdeppe J.,Can counter-advertising protect spectators of elite sport against the influence of unhealthy food and beverage sponsorship? A naturalistic trial,2020,"Rationale and objective: Unhealthy, energy-dense nutrient-poor foods and beverages are heavily promoted through sport sponsorship. This naturalistic trial assessed whether exposing young adult spectators to various types of counter-advertising (CA) before watching an unhealthy food sponsored elite sporting event could diminish sponsorship effects and increase support for restrictions on sponsorship. Method: Young adults (ages 18-29 years) who planned to watch the Australian Football League (AFL) Grand Final were recruited through an online panel and randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (A) control (neutral advertisement); (B) anti-industry CA (critiquing unhealthy food industry sponsorship of sport); (C) anti-product CA (critiquing the association of sports stars with unhealthy food); or (D) negative health effects CA (highlighting negative health consequences of unhealthy food consumption). Participants (N = 1316) completed a pre-test questionnaire and viewed their assigned CA online 1‚Äì3 days before watching the 2017 AFL Grand Final, which featured unhealthy food sponsorship. Results: Participants who reported watching the AFL Grand Final (n = 802) answered post-test measures within five days of the event. Results indicated that participants found the anti-industry CA more believable, attention-grabbing, reassuring and encouraging than the anti-product CA. The anti-industry CA promoted less favourable attitudes to sponsor brands, the anti-product CA promoted reduced intentions to purchase the fast-food sponsor brand, and the negative health effects CA reduced preferences for fast food in general compared to the control condition. Conclusions: Anti-industry CA may detract from favourable attitudes to unhealthy food sponsor brands and negative health effects CA may detract from intentions to consume fast food in the face of unhealthy food sponsorship exposure. Such interventions may require higher dosage levels than applied in the present study to bolster spectators‚Äô resistance to the surfeit of unhealthy food sport sponsorship. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113415,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Public Health,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,1316,The study showed that the anti-industry counter-advertising was more effective

Objective: To investigate how exposure to different marketing techniques from television (TV) and online food advertising affects children's brand recall, recognition, and attitudinal responses toward brands and brand consumers and children's desire to eat the advertised products. Design: Secondary analysis of data from a crossover experimental-control study. Participants/setting: In all, 154 children (7 to 12 years) completed the study, conducted at four 6-day holiday camps from April 2016 to January 2017 in New South Wales, Australia. Children were assigned to a single-media (n=76) or multiple-media (n=78) condition. Intervention: All children viewed 10 TV food advertisements in a cartoon on three occasions. For one of the brands, one set of children additionally played online ‚Äúadvergames‚Äù featuring the brand. Main outcome measures: Children's recognition and attitudes toward brands and brand consumers and children's desire to eat the product were reported via a brand recognition and attitude survey pre- and postintervention. Marketing techniques were categorized. Statistical analysis: Pre- and postintervention brand recognition and relationships between brand recognition and attitudes by media condition and desire to eat the product were examined using generalized linear mixed models and linear mixed models. Results: There was a significant increase in the number of brands recognized postexposure by children in both media groups (mean difference=3.8, P<0.0001). The majority of brands appealed to children. Children who reported wanting to eat the advertised products rated brands more positively than children who did not express a desire to eat the products. A larger proportion of children who played the advergames (36%) rated brand consumers as ‚Äúcool‚Äù than children who viewed the TV advertisements only (19%) (P<0.001). Anti-adult themes, fun and humor, and parent pleasing were techniques unique to some of the most recognized and favored advertisements. Conclusions: The marketing communications increased children's brand recognition and elicited positive attitudinal responses. These findings indicate a need for policy makers to consider additional regulations to protect children from the persuasive influence of unhealthy food advertising. ¬© 2020 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics",10.1016/j.jand.2019.05.006,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Advertising Regulation,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,154,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Gillitzer C.; Sinning M.,Nudging businesses to pay their taxes: Does timing matter?,2020,"This paper provides empirical evidence on the implications of the timing of reminders by studying the effect of varying the timing of reminder letters to taxpayers on their payment behavior. The collection of unpaid tax debts constitutes a considerable challenge for tax authorities. We discuss potential mechanisms through which reminders may affect taxpayers‚Äô behavior and study the payment behavior of business taxpayers in a field experiment in Australia. We find that a simple reminder letter increases the probability of payment by about 25 percentage points relative to a control group that does not receive a letter from the tax authority. However, variation over a three-week period in the timing of the reminder letter has no effect on the probability of payment within seven weeks of the due date. Our findings indicate that sending reminders early results in faster payment of debts with no effect on the ultimate probability of payment. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.jebo.2019.11.020,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Tax Compliance,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,I'm unsure.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Children prenatally exposed to alcohol or early life trauma (ELT) are at higher risk of impairment of these skills and may require intervention to address self-regulation deficits. Researchers partnered with the local Aboriginal health organization and schools to develop and pilot a manualized version of the Alert Program¬Æ in the Fitzroy Valley, north Western Australia, a region with documented high rates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and ELT. This self-controlled cluster randomized trial evaluated the effect of an 8-week Alert Program¬Æ intervention on children‚Äôs executive functioning and self-regulation skills. Following parent or caregiver consent (referred to hereafter as parent), 271 students were enrolled in the study. This reflects a 75% participation rate and indicates the strong community support that exists for the study. Teachers from 26 primary school classrooms across eight Fitzroy Valley schools received training to deliver eight, one-hour Alert Program¬Æ lessons over eight-weeks to students. Student outcomes were measured by parent and teacher ratings of children‚Äôs behavioral, emotional, and cognitive regulation. The mean number of lessons attended by children was 4.2. Although no significant improvements to children‚Äôs executive functioning skills or behavior were detected via the teacher-rated measures as hypothesized, statistically significant improvements were noted on parent-rated measures of executive functioning and behavior. The effectiveness of future self-regulation programs may be enhanced through multimodal delivery through home, school and community based settings to maximize children‚Äôs exposure to the intervention. Despite mixed findings of effect, this study was an important first step in adapting and evaluating the Alert Program¬Æ for use in remote Australian Aboriginal community schools, where access to self-regulation interventions is limited. ¬© 2020 Wagner et al.

We conducted a 2-group parallel-block randomised controlled trial comparing one 20-min session of action and coping planning to an assessment alone. Gamblers who were intending to set a monetary limit on EGMs (n = 184) were recruited in venues and administered the intervention prior to gambling. Measures were adherence to self-identified gambling limits and adherence to expenditure intentions at 30-days post-intervention using the Time Line Follow-Back. The intervention was feasible in terms of recruitment and willingness of gamblers to engage in a pre-gambling intervention. Most gamblers enacted strategies to limit their gambling prior to entering the venue, albeit these limits were on average higher than the Australian low risk gambling guidelines. In terms of impact, the intervention did not improve adherence to limits at post or 30-day follow-up assessment. However, Moderate Risk/Problem Gamblers in the Intervention group spent less (a median of $60 less) than intended (median $100) within the venue. All intervention participants intended to spend significantly less in the 30¬†days after the intervention compared to the amount spent in the 30¬†days prior to the intervention. This reduction was not found for participants in the control group. A simple brief intervention appears feasible in gambling venues and have an impact on gambling intentions over the short term. ¬© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10899-019-09873-w,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Gambling Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,184,The study did not show statistically significant results in improving adherence to gambling limits at

The aim of the OPTIMISE randomised trial was to evaluate the effect of dietary and exercise advice among pregnant women of normal body mass index (BMI), on pregnancy and birth outcomes. The trial was conducted in Adelaide, South Australia. Pregnant women with a body mass index in the healthy weight range (18.5‚Äì24.9 kg/m2) were enrolled in a randomised controlled trial of a dietary and lifestyle intervention versus standard antenatal care. The dietitian-led dietary and lifestyle intervention over the course of pregnancy was based on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.

Scully M.; Morley B.; Wakefield M.; Dixon H.,Can point-of-sale nutrition information and health warnings encourage reduced preference for sugary drinks?: An experimental study,2020,"Point-of-sale (POS) interventions that prompt consumers to more critically evaluate sugary drinks could encourage reduced consumption of these drinks and reinforce public health campaign messages. This study tested whether: (i) POS nutrition information and health warnings about sugary drinks promote healthier drink choices and (ii) impacts of prominent POS signs on drink choices vary based on participants‚Äô self-reported prior exposure to a sugary drink public health campaign. In an online experiment, 3034 Australian adults aged 18‚Äì59 years who were past-week sugary drink consumers were randomly assigned to one of five POS signage conditions (no signage (control); sugar content of specific beverages; Health Star Rating of specific beverages; generic text health warning about sugary drinks; generic graphic health warning about sugary drinks) and shown their randomly assigned POS sign alone, then alongside a drinks product display and asked to select which drink they would choose to buy. The proportion selecting a sugary drink was significantly lower among participants who viewed either the sugar content (29%), Health Star Rating (33%) or graphic health warning (34%) signs compared to those who saw no sign (43%). These effects held for participants who did not recall previously seeing the campaign; however, for participants with self-reported prior exposure to the campaign, POS signs did not promote significant reductions in sugary drink choices. POS signage has the potential to shift consumers away from choosing sugary drinks and could complement mass media campaigns by reaching people who may not otherwise be exposed to sugary drink public health messages. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.appet.2020.104612,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Public Health,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Regular RCT,3034,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Estai M.; Kanagasingam Y.; Mehdizadeh M.; Vignarajan J.; Norman R.; Huang B.; Spallek H.; Irving M.; Arora A.; Kruger E.; Tennant M.,Teledentistry as a novel pathway to improve dental health in school children: A research protocol for a randomised controlled trial,2020,"Background: Despite great improvement in child oral health, some children subgroups still suffer from higher levels of dental caries. Geographic and socioeconomic barriers and the lack of access to dental care services are among common reasons for poor oral health in children. Historically in Australia, oral health therapists or dental therapists have been responsible for providing dental care for school children through the School Dental Services (SDS). The current SDS has been unable to provide sustainable dental care to all school children due to a reduction in workforce participation and limited resources. We propose a paradigm shift in the current service through the introduction of user-friendly technology to provide a foundation for sustainable dental care for school children. Methods/design: We describe an ongoing parallel, two-Armed, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial that compares routine and teledental pathway of dental care in children aged 4-15 years (n = 250). Participating schools in Western Australia will be randomly assigned to the control or teledental group, approximately three schools in each group with a maximum of 45 children in each school. All participants will first receive a standard dental examination to identify those who require urgent referrals and then their teeth will be photographed using a smartphone camera. At the baseline, children in the control group will receive screening results and advice on the pathway of dental care based on the visual dental screening while children in the teledental group will receive screening results based on the assessment of dental images. At 9 months follow-up, all participants will undergo a final visual dental screening. The primary outcomes include decay experience and proportion of children become caries active. The secondary outcomes include the diagnostic performance of photographic dental assessment and costs comparison of two pathways of dental care. Discussion: The current project seeks to take advantage of mobile technology to acquire dental images from a child's mouth at school settings and forwarding images electronically to an offsite dental practitioner to assess and prepare dental recommendations remotely. Such an approach will help to prioritise high-risk children and provide them with a quick treatment pathway and avoid unnecessary referrals or travel.

Cardwell S.M.; Mazerolle L.; Piquero A.R.,Parental attachment and truant rationalizations of antisocial behavior: findings from a randomized controlled trial,2020,"Theorists propose that young people are likely to offend when they rationalize antisocial behavior and that pro-social attachments to parents might modify this relationship. This research first assesses whether or not a truancy reduction program is able to modify the effects of a young person‚Äôs rationalizations on antisocial behavior and then explores if parental attachments impact this relationship. Data are from the Ability School Engagement Program (ASEP), a third-party policing intervention designed to reduce truancy and crime by increasing parental knowledge of education laws in a sample of 102 high truanting youth from Brisbane, Australia. The conferences also incoorporated restorative and reintegrative shaming practices, which have previously been theorized to impact rationalizing behaviors. We find that post-intervention measures of rationalizations are positively related to self-reported antisocial behavior for those in the experimental condition. The impact of rationalizations on antisocial behavior varied at different levels of parental attachment only for the experimental group, as the effect of rationalizations on antisocial behavior became stronger at higher levels of parental attachments. We conclude that those in the experiment with strong parental attachments may have used more rationalizations to engage in antisocial behavior to overcome some of the pro-social effects of the ASEP intervention. ¬© 2019, ¬© 2019 Midwestern Criminal Justice Association.",10.1080/0735648X.2019.1668825,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Juvenile Delinquency,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,102,The study found that post-intervention measures of rationalizations were positively related to
Moore B.; Dudley D.; Woodcock S.,The effects of martial arts participation on mental and psychosocial health outcomes: A randomised controlled trial of a secondary school-based mental health promotion program,2019,"Background: Mental health problems are a significant social issue that have multiple consequences, including broad social and economic impacts. However, many individuals do not seek assistance for mental health problems. Limited research suggests martial arts training may be an efficacious sports-based mental health intervention that potentially provides an inexpensive alternative to psychological therapy. Unfortunately, the small number of relevant studies and other methodological problems lead to uncertainty regarding the validity and reliability of existing research. This study aims to examine the efficacy of a martial arts based therapeutic intervention to improve mental health outcomes. Methods/design: The study is a 10-week secondary school-based intervention and will be evaluated using a randomised controlled trial. Data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 12-week follow-up. Power calculations indicate a maximum sample size of n = 293 is required. The target age range of participants is 11-14 years, who will be recruited from government and catholic secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. The intervention will be delivered in a face-to-face group format onsite at participating schools and consists of 10 √ó 50-60 min sessions, once per week for 10 weeks. Quantitative outcomes will be measured using standardised psychometric instruments. Discussion: The current study utilises a robust design and rigorous evaluation process to explore the intervention's potential efficacy. As previous research examining the training effects of martial arts participation on mental health outcomes has not exhibited comparable scale or rigour, the findings of the study will provide valuable evidence regarding the efficacy of martial arts training to improve mental health outcomes.

Singh N.; Minaie M.G.; Skvarc D.R.; Toumbourou J.W.,Impact of a Secondary School Depression Prevention Curriculum on Adolescent Social-Emotional Skills: Evaluation of the Resilient Families Program,2019,"School-based mental health intervention programs have demonstrated efficacy for the prevention and reduction of depressive symptoms, though the effect tends to be variable and is often unsustained longitudinally. However, it is possible that these intervention programs may have an indirect impact on adolescent functioning via positive mediators, and that this influence may predict more durable protective benefits. This study evaluated the efficacy of the Resilient Families program for improving social-emotional skills and depressive symptoms for adolescents over a two-year period. Twenty-four secondary schools in Melbourne, Australia were randomly allocated to either Resilient Families or a control condition. 1826 students (M= 12.3, SD =.05 years at W1; 56% female) completed the curricula and subsequent surveys. Inconsistent with hypotheses, analysis with Structural Equation Modelling revealed that the program had no significant effect on social-emotional skills and these skills had no significant effects on adolescent depressive symptoms. However, family attendance at parent education events within the intervention schools was associated with longitudinal reductions in depressive symptoms. The findings highlight the importance of increasing emphasis on family and community protective factors in adolescent social-emotional development and depression prevention programs. ¬© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10964-019-00992-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Education Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,1826,The study did not show statistically significant results for the program's effect on social
Wright K.M.; Roberts R.; Proeve M.J.,Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) for Prevention of Internalizing Difficulties: a Small Randomized Controlled Trial with Australian Primary School Children,2019,"Objectives: The use of mindfulness-based programs (MBP) with children is rapidly growing, but calls for well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of existing programs. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) has preliminary evidence for targeting internalizing symptoms in children. Within MBCT-C (and MBPs more broadly), attention is thought to be a key component of change, but mediation has been relatively unexplored. The overall aim of this small RCT was to compare MBCT-C to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), as a preventive program for children experiencing internalizing difficulties. Methods: A mixed factorial design was used, with 2 (program group) by 2 (pre- and post-intervention) conditions. Children from 3 primary schools were randomized to MBCT-C (n = 45) or CBT (n = 44) using random permuted blocks, with stratification by school, gender, and age. Main analyses were multi-level mixed models. Results: Contrary to the hypotheses, only limited differences were found between programs. Both programs had small effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression, quality of life, attention control, and parent- and teacher-SDQ Total Difficulties, as well as moderate-large effects on shifting attention. There were no statistically significant changes in mindfulness or sustained attention. Conclusions: This RCT provides a robust test of MBCT-C in a ‚Äúreal life‚Äù setting, demonstrating that it may be used as a clinically oriented preventive program in schools to reduce internalizing symptoms. The results challenge whether attention (as measured in this study) is a unique component of change for MBCT-C. ¬© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s12671-019-01193-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Education Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,89,The study did not show statistically significant results.

Dads Tuning in to Kids (Dads TIK) is a parenting program that teaches fathers to coach their children in learning about emotions, while also helping fathers increase awareness and regulation of their own emotions. A randomized controlled efficacy trial of Dads TIK was conducted with a community sample of 162 fathers of a 4-year-old child attending preschool in Melbourne, Australia. Those allocated to the intervention attended a seven-session manualized group program. Questionnaires were completed by fathers, the fathers‚Äô partners and the children‚Äôs teachers at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Results were that fathers in the intervention condition but not control condition reported significant increases in emotion socialization, parenting satisfaction and efficacy, and reductions in their children‚Äôs difficult behaviors.

Prospective parents would like more information during pregnancy to prepare them for parenting, and need access to trusted and quality information. The Royal Women's Hospital (the Women's) in Melbourne, Australia, a large tertiary referral maternity hospital, developed a parenting education kit known as 'Growing Together'. The kit, designed to guide prospective and new parents from conception until 1 year after birth, includes three components: an A4 sized book, a specifically designed 'App' and a children's story book. We aim to evaluate the impact of the kit on a range of outcomes. Methods: A two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial will be used. Antenatal clinic days will be randomised to either the intervention or standard care arms. Women in the intervention arm receive the kit at their antenatal booking visit. Women in the standard care arm receive the standard information resources at the Women's. Analyses will be by intention to treat. Inclusion criteria: primiparous women with adequate English-speaking ability and ‚â§ 30 weeks' gestation at first pregnancy booking appointment. The primary outcome of the study is the 'experience of motherhood questionnaire' (EMQ), a 20 item validated self-report measure, ranging from 0 to 80, with lower scores indicating better maternal health and wellbeing. To detect a 10% difference in new mothers scoring ‚â§40 between women who have received the kit (60%) and those who have not (50%), would require 408 per group (total of 816 women) with 95% confidence and 80% power. Allowing for loss to follow up, we aim to recruit 1000 mothers. Secondary outcomes include parents' views and experiences of their care and of the kit during pregnancy and after the birth, parental attachment, knowledge, confidence, wellbeing and health-seeking behaviour; and emotional, developmental and physical health of the infant. Survey data will be collected from mothers at 2, 6 and 12 months postpartum and partners at 6 months. Discussion: This study will provide much needed high-level evidence on the impact of a comprehensive education resource for new parents.

Changes in actual store sales, from the pre-discount baseline period, were analysed for population impact on consumption of fruit and vegetables, water and artificially sweetened soft drinks, in addition with total dietary weight (grams), energy (Mega Joules), and sodium (milligrams). Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), arising from changes in dietary risk factor prevalence in the population, were estimated as the primary health outcome in a multi health-state Markov model. The costs of the strategies were sourced from paid invoices and time estimates of staff providing store-based discount promotion and consumer education. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio adopted a partial societal perspective, (including health and retail sector costs), as cost per DALY averted and was presented in 2011 Australian dollars. The price discount, helped address a gap in food price equity for residents of remote communities. However, the discount strategy, with or without consumer education led to a net loss of population health -36 95%CI (-47,-25) or -21(-28, -15) DALYs respectively, at increased cost to the retail and health sectors, of AUD860000 95%CI (710000, 1million) or AUD500000 (410000, 590000). The strategies trialled were thereby categorised as dominated by current practice while acknowledging considerable uncertainty surrounding the health outcome estimates. The 20% discount on limited targeted products appeared to need to be considered in conjunction with other marketing strategies to support healthy food choices, if remote Australian Indigenous population health is to be improved. ¬© 2018 Magnus et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0204005,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Public Health Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Clustered RCT,The sample size is not given.,The study did not show statistically significant results in terms of improving population health.
Goldfeld S.; Price A.; Kemp L.,"Designing, testing, and implementing a sustainable nurse home visiting program: Right@home",2018,"Nurse home visiting (NHV) offers a potential platform to both address the factors that limit access to services for families experiencing adversity and provide effective interventions. Currently, the ability to examine program implementation is hampered by a lack of detailed description of actual, rather than expected, program development and delivery in published studies. Home visiting implementation remains a black box in relation to quality and sustainability. However, previous literature would suggest that efforts to both report and improve program implementation are vital for NHV to have population impact and policy sustainability. In this paper, we provide a case study of the design, testing, and implementation of the right@home program, an Australian NHV program and randomized controlled trial. We address existing gaps related to implementation of NHV programs by describing the processes used to develop the program to be trialed, summarizing its effectiveness, and detailing the quality processes and implementation evaluation. The weight of our evidence suggests that NHV can be a powerful and sustainable platform for addressing inequitable outcomes, particularly when the program focuses on parent engagement and partnership, delivers evidence-based strategies shown to improve outcomes, includes fidelity monitoring, and is adapted to and embedded within existing service delivery systems. ¬© 2018 The Authors.",10.1111/nyas.13688,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Healthcare Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomized controlled trial (RCT),The sample size is not given.,The abstract does not provide specific information on whether the study showed statistically significant results

Background: The phenomenon of a growing ageing population increases the demand of optimum care for older people living in aged care facilities. Caring for older people is complex, but should include the management of aggressive interaction between them. Nursing staff play a vital role in identifying and managing those behaviours. However, many nurses may not recognise these aggressive interactions as abuse. Therefore, this study aims to manage and reduce this abuse through an educational programme. Design: Cluster randomised trial registered on the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12617001618347). Methods: This trial was undertaken in an aged care facility located in Melbourne, Australia and was funded in January 2017. Wards were randomly allocated (as the intervention and control group) by using sealed opaque envelopes. Nursing staff, who met eligibility, were consecutively recruited and supplied their informed consent. Nurses from the intervention group received an educational programme, while nurses from the control group continued with the usual standard care. Main outcomes included recognising, managing and reporting the abuse before and after the intervention and will be evaluated on an intention-to-treat analysis. Discussion: It is vital to manage and reduce resident-to-resident elder mistreatment. This educational programme may assist nursing staff to protect vulnerable older people experiencing this abuse and may improve comprehensive evidence-based care for older people residing in aged care facilities. ¬© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",10.1111/jan.13819,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Elder Care,This is a protocol/pre-analysis plan.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,The sample size is not given.,The description does not provide specific information about the results or whether they were statistically
Billich N.; Blake M.R.; Backholer K.; Cobcroft M.; Li V.; Peeters A.,"The effect of sugar-sweetened beverage front-of-pack labels on drink selection, health knowledge and awareness: An online randomised controlled trial",2018,"Purpose and aim: Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) provide little nutritional value and are associated with an increased risk of diet-related diseases. Despite this, SSB consumption is high globally. One emerging strategy aimed at reducing SSB consumption involves the use of front-of-pack (FOP) labels that clearly identify the risks associated with SSB consumption. The aim of this research study was to determine whether FOP labels with a graphic warning, text warning, sugar information (with the number of teaspoons of added sugar) or Health Star Rating (HSR) reduces intended choice of a SSB in an online choice experiment with young Australian adults. Results: 994 participants were recruited and completed the online choice experiment. Compared to the control group who were not exposed to a label, the graphic warning, text warning, sugar information and HSR labels all significantly reduced selection of a SSB in the choice scenario. The magnitude of effect was greatest for the graphic warning label (OR 0.22 95% CI 0.14‚Äì0.35). Compared to the control group, only the HSR label significantly increased selections of the high HSR drinks (OR 2.18 95% CI 1.20‚Äì3.97). Conclusions: FOP labels, particularly those with graphic warnings, have the potential to reduce intended SSB purchases. Labels that also identify healthier alternatives may influence consumers to substitute SSBs with healthier drinks. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.appet.2018.05.149,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Public Health,Full study with results.,Survey experiment,Online randomised controlled trial,994,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Design Cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomised trial with continuous recruitment, short (fixed) exposure and blinded outcome assessors. Nurses were stratified by hours worked and randomised into training groups using a computer generated sequence. Setting An Australian national pregnancy and parenting telephone helpline. Intervention Complex intervention involving a single 2-hour group Teach-Back training session, combined with ongoing nurse self-reflection on their communication following each call and each shift. Participants Participants were 637 callers to the telephone helpline aged 18-75 (87% female), of whom 127 (13%) had inadequate health literacy (measured with the Single Item Literacy Screener); and 15 maternal and child health nurses with 15 years' experience on average. Measures Primary outcome was a modified subscale of the Health Literacy Questionnaire, 'having sufficient information to manage health'. Secondary caller outcomes included caller confidence, perceived actionability of information and nurse effort to listen and understand. Nurse outcomes were perceptions of their communication effectiveness. Results Over a 7 week period, 376 surveyed callers received usual care and 261 Teach-Back. Ratings on the primary outcome increased over time (OR 1.17, CI 1.01 to 1.32, p = 0.03) but no independent Teach-Back effect was observed. A consistent pattern suggests that, compared with usual care, Teach-Back helps callers with inadequate health literacy feel listened to (OR 2.3, CI 0.98 to 5.42, p = 0.06), confident to act (OR 2.44, CI 1.00 to 5.98, p = 0.06), and know what steps to take (OR 2.68, CI 1.00 to 7.17, p = 0.06). Nurse perceptions of both their own communication effectiveness (OR = 2.31; CI 1.38 to 3.86, p<0.0001), and caller understanding (OR = 2.56; CI 1.52 to 4.30, p<0.001) both increased with Teach-Back. No harms were reported. Conclusions Teach-Back appears to benefit telephone health service users with inadequate health literacy, but the extent of this is unclear due to smaller numbers of lower literacy participants. Improving caller ratings over time are likely due to increasing nurse communication competence. ¬© 2018 Morony et al.

There is compelling evidence to show that specific exercise programs can reduce the risk and rate of falls in community-dwelling older people. Another major health issue for older people living in the community is upper limb dysfunction, including shoulder pain. Home-based exercise programs appeal to some older people, due to their convenience. Research questions: This trial aims to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a home-based lower limb exercise program compared with a home-based upper limb exercise program to prevent falls and upper limb dysfunction among community-dwelling people aged 65+ years. Design: Randomised, controlled trial. Participants and setting: A total of 576 community-dwelling people will be recruited from the Illawarra and Shoalhaven regions of New South Wales, Australia. Intervention: Participants will be randomised to either a home-based lower limb exercise intervention or a home-based upper limb exercise intervention. The lower limb program is designed to improve balance and strength in the lower limbs. The upper limb program is designed to improve upper limb strength and mobility. Participants will attend three group-based instruction sessions to learn and progress the exercises, and will be instructed to perform the exercises three times per week at home for 12 months. Outcome measures: The two primary outcomes will be fall rates, recorded with monthly calendars for a 12-month period, and upper limb dysfunction, measured with the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will include: lower limb strength and balance; shoulder strength and mobility; physical activity; quality of life; attitudes to exercise; proportion of fallers; fear of falling; and health and community service use. The cost-effectiveness of both exercise programs from a health and community service provider perspective will be evaluated. Analysis: Negative binomial regression models will be used to estimate the between-group difference in fall rates. Modified Poisson regression models will be used to compare groups on dichotomous outcome measures. Linear regression models will be used to assess the effect of group allocation on the continuously scored measures, after adjusting for baseline scores. Two economic evaluations will be conducted: the first will assess cost-effectiveness of the lower limb program compared with the upper limb program; and the second will assess cost-effectiveness of the upper limb program compared with the lower limb program. Discussion: If effective, the trial will provide a model for both upper limb and lower limb exercise programs that can be performed at home and implemented at scale to community-dwelling older adults. ¬© 2017 Australian Physiotherapy Association",10.1016/j.jphys.2017.10.001,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Public Health,This is a protocol / pre-analysis plan.,Field experiment,"Randomised, controlled trial (RCT)",576,"The description provided is a study protocol, which outlines the design and methodology of"

The purpose of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness training intervention in reducing stress and burnout among medical practitioners, by means of a Randomised Controlled Trial design. Methods: Participants were 44 intern doctors completing an emergency department rotation in a major Australian hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to either an active control (one hour extra break per week) or the 10-week mindfulness training intervention. Measures of stress and burnout were taken pre-, mid- and post intervention. Results: Participants undergoing the 10-week mindfulness training program reported greater improvements in stress and burnout relative to participants in the control condition. Significant reduction in stress and burnout was observed for participants in the mindfulness condition. No such reductions were observed for participants in the control condition. Conclusions: Mindfulness interventions may provide medical practitioners with skills to effectively manage stress and burnout, thereby reducing their experience of these symptoms. It is likely that doctors would benefit from the inclusion of such a training program as a part of their general medical education. ¬© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/0142159X.2017.1294749,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Healthcare Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT),44,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

A Randomised-Controlled Trial,2018,"The efficacy of an enhanced version of the Aussie Optimism Program (AOP) was investigated in a cluster randomized controlled trial. Grade 6 students aged 10-11 years of age (N = 2288) from 63 government primary schools in Perth, Western Australia, participated in the pre, post, and follow-up study. Schools were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Aussie Optimism with teacher training, Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching, or a usual care condition that received the regular Western Australian Health Education Curriculum. Students in the Aussie Optimism conditions received 20, 1-h lessons relating to social and interpersonal skills and optimistic thinking skills over the last 2 years of primary school. Parents in the active conditions received a parent information booklet each year, plus a self-directed program in Grade 7. Students and parents completed the Extended Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Students who scored in the clinical range on the Emotional Symptoms Scale were given The Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents IV, to assess suicidal ideation and behavior, and depressive and anxiety disorders. Results indicated that Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching was associated with the best outcomes: A significant increase in student-reported pro-social behavior from pre-test to post-test 1 (maintained at post-test 2) and significantly lower incidence rates from suicidal ideation at post-test 2 and follow-up. No significant intervention effects on anxiety and depressive disorders, and total difficulties were reported. These findings suggest that the AOP with teacher training along with coaching may have the potential to positively impact on suicidality and pro-social behavior in the pre-adolescent years. ¬© 2018 Roberts, Kane, Rooney, Pintabona, Baughman, Hassan, Cross, Zubrick and Silburn.",10.3389/FPSYG.2017.01392,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Education Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,2288,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

In Australia, students are primarily vaccinated en masse, on school grounds, after parental/ guardian consent is obtained. Students most often receive little, or no, education at school about HPV or HPV vaccination prior to immunisation. There is also some uncertainty about where young people can and should obtain reliable information about the vaccine, outside of school. We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention in schools. This study aimed to improve: (1) student knowledge about HPV vaccination; (2) psycho-social outcomes and (3) vaccination uptake. In this paper, we briefly outline our educational intervention and discuss its implementation by educators including facilitators and barriers. We also discuss the study findings pertaining to student knowledge about HPV and HPV vaccination and their attitudes to vaccination across control and intervention schools. Study results showed students in intervention schools demonstrate greater knowledge and understanding of HPV and HPV vaccination. Greater knowledge and understanding of HPV and HPV vaccination appeared to promote positive attitudes towards vaccination and supported confidence with vaccination. ¬© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/14681811.2017.1300770,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Public Health,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,I'm unsure.,The description does not provide specific information about whether the study showed statistically significant results
McLeod L.J.; Hine D.W.; Bengsen A.J.; Driver A.B.,Assessing the impact of different persuasive messages on the intentions and behaviour of cat owners: A randomised control trial,2017,"Owners of free-ranging domestic cats (Felis catus) are under increasing pressure to keep their pet contained within their house or yard, in an effort to reduce adverse impacts on cat welfare, ecosystem biodiversity and neighbourhoods. We conducted a randomised online experiment to assess the effectiveness of two persuasive messages to encourage cat owners to contain their pets. A total of 512 Australian cat owners, who currently do not contain their cats, were randomly assigned to view one of three short video messages: one framed to highlight the negative impact of cats‚Äô on wildlife and biodiversity (‚Äòwildlife protection‚Äô frame), one framed to highlight the health and safety benefits of keeping cats contained (‚Äòcat benefit‚Äô frame), and a control message focused on general information about cats (‚Äòneutral‚Äô frame). We assessed the impact of these video messages on two post-treatment outcome variables: (1) the intention of owners to contain their cat; and (2) the adoption of containment practices, based on a 4-week follow-up survey. Mediation analysis revealed both the ‚Äòwildlife protection‚Äô and ‚Äòcat benefit‚Äô messages increased owners‚Äô motivation to contain their cat and their beliefs that they could effectively contain their cat to achieve the desired outcomes (response efficacy). In turn, higher levels of motivation and response efficacy predicted increased cat containment intentions and increased adoption of cat containment. In addition, the response efficacy effects of the ‚Äòcat benefit‚Äô message were strengthened by the cat owner's bond to their pet, suggesting audience segmentation may improve the effectiveness of interventions. Implications for future intervention development are discussed. ¬© 2017 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.08.005,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Animal Welfare,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised control trial (RCT),512,The study showed statistically significant results.

Participants were 106 female undergraduate students randomly assigned to view one of three sets of images (thin ideal, athletic ideal, or muscular ideal) followed by a bout of exercise. Acute exposure to athletic ideal and thin ideal images led to increased body dissatisfaction, but exposure to muscular ideal images did not. Relative to thin ideal images, fitness-idealised images did not motivate participants to engage in higher levels of exercise suggesting that this type of fitness inspiration might not motivate actual exercise behaviour. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.bodyim.2017.06.001,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Body Image,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,106,The study showed that acute exposure to athletic ideal and thin ideal images led to

Computer assisted learning (CAL) is the implementation of computer technology in education. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a remote-online CBL (RO-CBL) with traditional face-to-face CBL on learning the outcomes of undergraduate physiotherapy students. Methods: Participants were randomized to either the control (face-to-face CBL) or to the CAL intervention (RO-CBL). The entire 3rd year physiotherapy cohort (n = 41) at Monash University, Victoria, Australia, were invited to participate in the randomized controlled trial. Outcomes included a postintervention multiple-choice test evaluating the knowledge gained from the CBL, a self-assessment of learning based on examinable learning objectives and student satisfaction with the CBL. In addition, a focus group was conducted investigating perceptions and responses to the online format. Results: Thirty-eight students (control n = 19, intervention n = 19) participated in two CBL sessions and completed the outcome assessments. CBL median scores for the postintervention multiple-choice test were comparable (Wilcoxon rank sum P = 0.61) (median/10 [range] intervention group: 9 [8‚Äì10] control group: 10 [7‚Äì10]). Of the 15 examinable learning objectives, eight were significantly in favor of the control group, suggesting a greater perceived depth of learning. Eighty-four percent of students (16/19) disagreed with the statement ‚ÄúI enjoyed the method of CBL delivery.‚Äù Key themes identified from the focus group included risks associated with the implementation of, challenges of communicating in, and flexibility offered, by web-based programs.

The Cyber-Friendly Schools (CFS) program has three components, designed for (1) the whole-school community, (2) students, and (3) parents. Each component provides teaching and learning resources, access to an online website resource, and training. The program also involves the recruitment and training of students to act as ‚Äúcyber leaders‚Äù for their school community. In a randomized controlled trial, over 3000 Grade 8 students received the intervention and were tracked for 2 years. The intervention reduced the likelihood of new cases of cybervictimization and cyberperpetration by Grade 9, but these declines did not persist in the following year. School staff struggled to find time to fit the intervention into their usual teaching program, which may have attenuated the intervention‚Äôs effectiveness.

Methods A randomized control trial with random allocation of parent/child dyads with ECC to test (minimum intervention) or control (standard care). Participating parents completed the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) at baseline and follow-up. Changes in ECOHIS scores and extent of COHRQoL impacts between and within groups were tested using the chi-squared statistic for groups, Wilcoxon's rank-sum test, and matched-pairs signed-rank test. Results Two hundred and fifty-four children were randomized (test = 127; control = 127).

To date, few programs addressing cyberbullying have been developed and empirically tested. The Cyber Friendly Schools (CFS) group-randomized controlled trial measured the longitudinal impact of a whole-school online cyberbullying prevention and intervention program, developed in partnership with young people. Non-government secondary schools in Perth, Western Australia, (N=35; 3,000+ students) were randomized to an intervention (n=19) or usual practice control group (n=16 schools). Students completed online questionnaires in 2010, 2011, and at 1-year follow-up in 2012, measuring their cyberbullying experiences during the previous school term. The intervention group received the program in Grades 8 and 9 (aged 13-14 years). Program effects were tested using two-part growth models. The program was associated with significantly greater declines in the odds of involvement in cyber-victimization and perpetration from pre- to the first post-test, but no other differences were evident between the study conditions. However, teachers implemented only one third of the program content. More work is needed to build teacher capacity and self-efficacy to effectively implement cyberbullying programs. Whole-school cyberbullying interventions implemented in conjunction with other bullying prevention programs may reduce cyber-victimization more than traditional school-based bullying prevention programs alone.

However, robust evidence of the cost-effectiveness of pricing manipulations on dietary behaviour is limited. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a 20% price reduction on fruits and vegetables and a combined skills-based behaviour change and price reduction intervention. Design and methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective was undertaken for the randomized controlled trial Supermarket Healthy Eating for Life (SHELf). Female shoppers in Melbourne, Australia were randomized to: (1) skill-building (n = 160); (2) price reductions (n = 161); (3) combined skill-building and price reduction (n = 161); or (4) control group (n = 161). The intervention was implemented for three months followed by a six month follow-up. Costs were measured in 2012 Australian dollars. Fruit and vegetable purchasing and consumption were measured in grams/week. Results: At three months, compared to control participants, price reduction participants increased vegetable purchases by 233 g/week (95% CI 4 to 462, p = 0.046) and fruit purchases by 364 g/week (95% CI 95 to 633, p = 0.008). Participants in the combined group purchased 280 g/week more fruits (95% CI 27 to 533, p = 0.03) than participants in the control group. Increases were not maintained six-month post intervention. No effect was noticed in the skill-building group. Compared to the control group, the price reduction intervention cost an additional A$2.3 per increased serving of vegetables purchased per week or an additional A$3 per increased serving of fruit purchased per week. The combined intervention cost an additional A$12 per increased serving of fruit purchased per week compared to the control group. Conclusions: A 20% discount on fruits and vegetables was effective in promoting overall fruit and vegetable purchases during the period the discount was active and may be cost-effective.

The present study aimed to experimentally investigate the impact of fitspiration images on women's body image. Participants were 130 female undergraduate students who were randomly assigned to view either a set of Instagram fitspiration images or a control set of travel images presented on an iPad. Results showed that acute exposure to fitspiration images led to increased negative mood and body dissatisfaction and decreased state appearance self-esteem relative to travel images. Importantly, regression analyses showed that the effects of image type were mediated by state appearance comparison. Thus it was concluded that fitspiration can have negative unintended consequences for body image.

Design Pragmatic cluster randomised trial where volunteer general practices were stratified by postcode advantage or disadvantage score and billing type (private, free national health, community health centre), then randomised into either intervention or comparison arms using a computer generated random sequence. Three months post-intervention, patients were recruited from all practices post-consultation for a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview and followed up three and 12 months later. Researchers recruiting, consenting and interviewing patients and patients themselves were masked to allocation status; clinicians were not. Setting General practices in metropolitan and rural Victoria, Australia Participants General practices with at least one interested clinician (general practitioner or nurse) and their 14-24 year old patients. Intervention This complex intervention was designed using evidence based practice in learning and change in clinician behaviour and general practice systems, and included best practice approaches to motivating change in adolescent risk taking behaviours. The intervention involved training clinicians (nine hours) in health risk screening, use of a screening tool and motivational interviewing; training all practice staff (receptionists and clinicians) in engaging youth; provision of feedback to clinicians of patients' risk data; and two practice visits to support new screening and referral resources. Comparison clinicians received one didactic educational seminar (three hours) on engaging youth and health risk screening. Outcome Measures Primary outcomes were patient report of (1) clinician detection of at least one of six health risk behaviours (tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug use, risks for sexually transmitted infection, STI, unplanned pregnancy, and road risks); and (2) change in one or more of the six health risk behaviours, at three months or at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were likelihood of future visits, trust in the clinician after exit interview, clinician detection of emotional distress and fear and abuse in relationships, and emotional distress at three and 12 months. Patient acceptability of the screening tool was also described for the intervention arm. Analyses were adjusted for practice location and billing type, patients' sex, age, and recruitment method, and past health risks, where appropriate. An intention to treat analysis approach was used, which included multilevel multiple imputation for missing outcome data. Results 42 practices were randomly allocated to intervention or comparison arms. Two intervention practices withdrew post allocation, prior to training, leaving 19 intervention (53 clinicians, 377 patients) and 21 comparison (79 clinicians, 524 patients) practices. 69% of patients in both intervention (260) and comparison (360) arms completed the 12 month follow-up. Intervention clinicians discussed more health risks per patient (59.7%) than comparison clinicians (52.7%) and thus were more likely to detect a higher proportion of young people with at least one of the six health risk behaviours (38.4% vs 26.7%, risk difference [RD] 11.6%, Confidence Interval [CI] 2.93% to 20.3%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.7, CI 1.1 to 2.5). Patients reported less illicit drug use (RD -6.0, CI -11 to -1.2; OR 0¬∑52, CI 0¬∑28 to 0¬∑96), and less risk for STI (RD -5.4, CI -11 to 0.2; OR 0¬∑66, CI 0¬∑46 to 0¬∑96) at three months in the intervention relative to the comparison arm, and for unplanned pregnancy at 12 months (RD-4.4; CI -8.7 to -0.1; OR 0¬∑40, CI 0¬∑20 to 0¬∑80). No differences were detected between arms on other health risks. There were no differences on secondary outcomes, apart from a greater detection of abuse (OR 13.8, CI 1.71 to 111). There were no reports of harmful events and intervention arm youth had high acceptance of the screening tool. Conclusions A complex intervention, compared to a simple educational seminar for practices, improved detection of health risk behaviours in young people. Impact on health outcomes was inconclusive. Technology enabling more efficient, systematic health-risk screening may allow providers to target counselling toward higher risk individuals. Further trials require more power to confirm health benefits. ¬© 2015 Sanci et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0137581,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Public Health,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A clustered RCT,901,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

A pretest, posttest parallel group, single blind multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted with 308 students between the ages of 4 and 8 years old (M age = 5.8 years, SD = 0.8 years). Findings suggested that computer-based instruction under controlled conditions can improve student literacy, especially for Indigenous students at risk of reading difficulties. The authors examine the fidelity with which the computer-based literacy tool was implemented and the impact of implementation fidelity measures on student outcomes. Student exposure to and use of the literacy tool, and quality of instruction and lesson delivery, were analyzed for their influence on students literacy outcomes. Implementation fidelity measures accounted for between 1.8% and 15% of the variance of intervention students scores. ¬© 2014 Copyright ¬© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/00220671.2013.823369,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Education Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,A regular RCT,308,The description does not explicitly state whether the results were statistically significant.

Waghorn G.; Dias S.; Gladman B.; Harris M.; Saha S.,A multi-site randomised controlled trial of evidence-based supported employment for adults with severe and persistent mental illness,2014,"Background/aim: The Individual Placement and Support (IPS) approach is an evidence-based form of supported employment for people with severe and persistent mental illness. This approach is not yet widely available in Australia even though there is mounting evidence of its generalisability outside the USA. One previous Australian randomised controlled trial found that IPS is effective for young people with first episode psychosis. The aim of the current trial was to assess the effectiveness of evidence-based supported employment when implemented for Australian adult consumers of public mental health services by utilising existing service systems. Methods: A four-site randomised control trial design (n = 208) was conducted in Brisbane (two sites), Townsville and Cairns. The intervention consisted of an IPS supported employment service hosted by a community mental health team. The control condition was delivered at each site by mental health teams referring consumers to other disability employment services in the local area. Results: At 12 months, those in the IPS condition had 2.4 times greater odds of commencing employment than those in the control condition (42.5% vs. 23.5%). The conditions did not differ on secondary employment outcomes including job duration, hours worked, or job diversity. Attrition was higher than expected in both conditions with 28.4% completing the baseline interview but taking no further part in the study. Conclusion: The results support previous international findings that IPS-supported employment is more effective than non-integrated supported employment. IPS can be successfully implemented this way in Australia, but with a loss of effect strength compared to previous USA trials. ¬© 2014 Occupational Therapy Australia.",10.1111/1440-1630.12148,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Mental Health Employment,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,208,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Antrobus E.; Elffers H.; White G.; Mazerolle L.,Nonresponse bias in randomized controlled experiments in criminology: Putting the Queensland Community Engagement Trial (QCET) under a microscope,2013,"Method: We use two methods (Cochrane and Elffers methods) to explore nonresponse bias: First, we assess the impact of the low response rate by examining the effects of nonresponse group differences between the experimental and control conditions and pooled variance under different scenarios. Second, we assess the degree to which item response rates are influenced by the control and experimental conditions.; Results: Our analysis of the QCET data suggests that our substantive findings are not influenced by the low response rate in the trial. The results are robust even under extreme conditions, and statistical significance of the results would only be compromised in cases where the pooled variance was much larger for the nonresponse group and the difference between experimental and control conditions was greatly diminished. We also find that there were no biases in the item response rates across the experimental and control conditions.; Conclusion: RCTs that involve field survey responses‚Äîlike QCET‚Äîare potentially compromised by low response rates and how item response rates might be influenced by the control or experimental conditions. Our results show that the QCET results were not sensitive to the overall low response rate across the experimental and control conditions and the item response rates were not significantly different across the experimental and control groups. Overall, our analysis suggests that the results of QCET are robust and any biases in the survey responses do not significantly influence the main experimental findings.; Objectives: The goal of this article is to examine whether or not the results of the Queensland Community Engagement Trial (QCET)‚Äîa randomized controlled trial that tested the impact of procedural justice policing on citizen attitudes toward police‚Äîwere affected by different types of nonresponse bias. ¬© The Author(s) 2014.",10.1177/0193841X13518534,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Criminology,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The study showed that the results of the Queensland Community Engagement Trial (QCET

Exercise interventions can reduce fall risk, but adherence is often low. A new exergame involving step training may provide an enjoyable exercise alternative for preventing falls in older people. Purpose: To assess the feasibility and safety of unsupervised, home-based step pad training and determine the effectiveness of this intervention on stepping performance and associated fall risk in older people. Design: Single-blinded two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing step pad training with control (no-intervention). Setting/Participants: Thirty-seven older adults residing in independent-living units of a retirement village in Sydney, Australia. Intervention: Intervention group (IG) participants were provided with a computerized step pad system connected to their TVs and played a step game as often as they liked (with a recommended dose of 2-3 sessions per week for 15-20 minutes each) for eight weeks. In addition, IG participants were asked to complete a choice stepping reaction time (CSRT) task once each week. Main Outcome Measures: CSRT, the Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA), neuropsychological and functional mobility measures were assessed at baseline and eight week follow-up. Results: Thirty-two participants completed the study (86.5%). IG participants played a median 2.75 sessions/week and no adverse events were reported. Compared to the control group, the IG significantly improved their CSRT (F31,1 = 18.203, p<.001), PPA composite scores (F31,1 = 12.706, p = 0.001), as well as the postural sway (F31,1 = 4.226, p = 0.049) and contrast sensitivity (F31,1 = 4.415, p = 0.044) PPA sub-component scores. In addition, the IG improved significantly in their dual-task ability as assessed by a timed up and go test/verbal fluency task (F31,1 = 4.226, p = 0.049). Conclusions: Step pad training can be safely undertaken at home to improve physical and cognitive parameters of fall risk in older people without major cognitive and physical impairments.

Parry S.; Straker L.; Gilson N.D.; Smith A.J.,Participatory workplace interventions can reduce sedentary time for office workers - A randomised controlled trial,2013,"Background: Occupational sedentary behaviour is an important contributor to overall sedentary risk. There is limited evidence for effective workplace interventions to reduce occupational sedentary time and increase light activity during work hours. The purpose of the study was to determine if participatory workplace interventions could reduce total sedentary time, sustained sedentary time (bouts >30 minutes), increase the frequency of breaks in sedentary time and promote light intensity activity and moderate/vigorous activity (MVPA) during work hours. Methods: A randomised controlled trial (ANZCTR number: ACTN12612000743864) was conducted using clerical, call centre and data processing workers (n = 62, aged 25-59 years) in 3 large government organisations in Perth, Australia. Three groups developed interventions with a participatory approach: 'Active office' (n = 19), 'Active Workstation' and promotion of incidental office activity; 'Traditional physical activity' (n = 14), pedometer challenge to increase activity between productive work time and 'Office ergonomics' (n = 29), computer workstation design and breaking up computer tasks. Accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X, 7 days) determined sedentary time, sustained sedentary time, breaks in sedentary time, light intensity activity and MVPA on work days and during work hours were measured before and following a 12 week intervention period. Results: For all participants there was a significant reduction in sedentary time on work days (-1.6%, p = 0.006) and during work hours (-1.7%, p = 0.014) and a significant increase in number of breaks/sedentary hour on work days (0.64, p = 0.005) and during work hours (0.72, p = 0.015); there was a concurrent significant increase in light activity during work hours (1.5%, p = 0.012) and MVPA on work days (0.6%, p = 0.012). Conclusions: This study explored novel ways to modify work practices to reduce occupational sedentary behaviour. Participatory workplace interventions can reduce sedentary time, increase the frequency of breaks and improve light activity and MVPA of office workers by using a variety of interventions.

Kemp L.; Harris E.; Mcmahon C.; Matthey S.; Vimpani G.; Anderson T.; Schmied V.; Aslam H.,Benefits of psychosocial intervention and continuity of care by child and family health nurses in the pre- and postnatal period: Process evaluation,2013,"Aim: To report a programme theory for pre-natal home visiting by nurses in the context of a sustained nurse home visiting programme by exploring pre- and postnatal outcomes and characteristics of the intervention that may have contributed to the outcomes. Background: Studies have shown sustained nurse home visiting commencing pre-natally to be effective. Few studies have explored the processes by which pre-natal activities by nurses contribute to achieving effective outcomes. Design: Process evaluation. Methods: Process and outcome data from a randomized controlled trial of sustained nurse home visiting in an area of socioeconomic disadvantage in Western Sydney between 2005-2008 were collated. The pre-natal intervention focused on improving transition to parenting by supporting mothers through pregnancy. Health and service use outcome data were analysed for 208 women (111 intervention; 97 comparison receiving usual care). Five nurses delivering the intervention completed checklists detailing activities undertaken. Results: Nurses provided information, psychosocial support, and health promoting activities for families. Intervention mothers had a higher rate of unassisted vaginal births than the general population. Compared with comparison mothers, intervention mothers at 4-6¬†weeks postnatally reported better general health and felt significantly more enabled to cope with and understand their baby and to care for themselves and their baby. Conclusion: Comprehensive support, in a context of enabling client-nurse relationships and continuity of carer are the ways by which antenatal nurse home visiting achieves benefits for women and infants, having an impact on both clinical outcomes such as rates of normal vaginal delivery and maternal service engagement. ¬© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",10.1111/jan.12052,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Maternal Health,This is a full study with results.,Something else,Process evaluation,208,The study reported that intervention mothers had a higher rate of unassisted vaginal

Two-hundred and twenty four households from a small regional center in Australia were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: (1) Education only - households received a wood smoke reduction education pack containing information about the negative health impacts of wood smoke pollution, and advice about wood heater operation and firewood management; (2) SmartBurn only - households received a SmartBurn canister designed to improve combustion and help wood fires burn more efficiently, (3) Education and SmartBurn, and (4) neither Education nor SmartBurn (control). Analysis of covariance, controlling for pre-intervention household wood smoke emissions, wood moisture content, and wood heater age, revealed that education and SmartBurn were both associated with significant reduction in wood smoke emissions during the post-intervention period. Follow-up mediation analyses indicated that education reduced emissions by improving wood heater operation practices, but not by increasing health risk perceptions. As predicted, SmartBurn exerted a direct effect on emission levels, unmediated by wood heater operation practices or health risk perceptions. ¬© 2011.",10.1016/j.jenvp.2011.05.003,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Environmental Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,224,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of a 6 week, web-based cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) intervention with and without proactive weekly telephone tracking in the reduction of depression in callers to a helpline service. Method: 155 callers to a national helpline service with moderate to high psychological distress were recruited and randomised to receive either Internet CBT plus weekly telephone follow-up; Internet CBT only; weekly telephone follow-up only; or treatment as usual. Results: Depression was lower in participants in the web intervention conditions both with and without telephone tracking compared to the treatment as usual condition both at post intervention and at 6 month follow-up. Telephone tracking provided by a lay telephone counsellor did not confer any additional advantage in terms of symptom reduction or adherence.

Gambling behavior; including bet-size, speed of betting, final payouts and trials played on the EGM; was investigated with respect to participants' assigned arousal condition, problem-gambling status, and affective state. At-risk gamblers with few self-reported negative emotions placed higher average bets at the EGM after having held the crocodile when compared to the control. In contrast, at-risk gamblers with many self-reported negative emotions placed lower average bets at the EGM after having held the crocodile. The results suggest that high arousal can intensify gambling in at-risk players, but only if this feeling state is not perceived as a negative emotion. ¬© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",10.1007/s10899-009-9174-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Gambling Behavior,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,103,The study suggests that high arousal can intensify gambling in at-risk players
Rodrigo S.; Sinclair M.; Leder K.,A survey of the characteristics and maintenance of rainwater tanks in urban areas of South Australia,2010,"Households resident in metropolitan Adelaide and surrounding areas in South Australia were recruited into a randomised controlled trial. A total of 630 rainwater tanks with a total tank capacity of 14.5ML were installed at the 325 households surveyed. The majority of the tanks were plumbed into the kitchen (64.6%), over 10 years in age (45.5%), over 15,000 L in capacity (42.5%) and composed of galvanised steel (36.9%). Over 90% of the households undertook one or more prevention and maintenance strategies for reducing contamination of collected rainwater. The use of first flush diverters was reported by 30.8% households, the presence of leaf control devices on the tank by 57.2%, and the presence of leaf control screens on gutters by 25.5% households. Most households reported that the rainwater tank was cleaned at some time, with 50.4% of these households stating that tank cleaning occurred 1 to 5 years previously, and 31.9% more than 5 years prior to enrolment Rainwater from the main drinking tank was sampled from a subset of households for turbidity and metals (Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Pb, Zn). This information regarding tank characteristics and degree of adherence to recommended maintenance procedures may assist understanding of variability in rainwater quality data and may help determine whether untreated rainwater can be considered a safe water supply for household purposes including drinking. ¬© IWA Publishing 2010.",10.2166/wst.2010.055,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Water Management,This is a full study with results.,Survey experiment,Unsure,325,The description does not provide information on whether the study showed statistically significant results.
Clemson L.; Singh M.F.; Bundy A.; Cumming R.G.; Weissel E.; Munro J.; Manollaras K.; Black D.,LiFE Pilot Study: A randomised trial of balance and strength training embedded in daily life activity to reduce falls in older adults,2010,"Background: Exercise as a falls prevention strategy is more complex with people at risk than with the general population. The Lifestyle approach to reducing Falls through Exercise (LiFE) involves embedding balance and lower limb strength training in habitual daily routines. Methods: A total of 34 community-residing people aged ‚â•70 years were randomised either into the LiFE programme or into a no-intervention control group and followed up for six months. Inclusion criteria were two or more falls or an injurious fall in the past year. Results: There were 12 falls in the intervention group and 35 in the control group. Therelative risk (RR) analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in falls (RR = 0.23; 0.07-0.83). There were indications that dynamic balance (P = 0.04 at three months) and efficacy beliefs (P = 0.04 at six months) improved for the LiFE programme participants. In general, secondary physical and health status outcomes, which were hypothesised as potential mediators of fall risk, improved minimally and inconsistently. Conclusions: LiFE was effective in reducing recurrent falls in this at-risk sample. However, there were minimal changes in secondary measures. The study was feasible in terms of recruitment, randomisation, blinding and data collection. A larger randomised trial is needed to investigate long-term efficacy, mechanisms of benefit and clinical significance of this new intervention. ¬© 2010 The Authors.

White E.; Winstanley J.,"A randomised controlled trial of clinical supervision: Selected findings from a novel Australian attempt to establish the evidence base for causal relationships with quality of care and patient outcomes, as an informed contribution to mental health nursing practice development",2010,"This paper reports on selected findings from a novel randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in mental health settings in Queensland, Australia. Several national and state reports recently revealed the sub-optimal state of Australian mental health service provision which have direct implications for mental health nursing, including the privately experienced cost of working and coping in these settings. Clinical supervision (CS), a structured staff support arrangement, has shown promise as a positive contribution to the clinical practice development agenda and is now found reflected in health policy themes elsewhere in the world. However, CS is underdeveloped in Australia and the empirical evidence base for the informed implementation of CS, per se, has remained elusive. Within the overall context of a RCT design, therefore, and supplemented by other data collection methods, this large and generously funded study attempted to make an incremental contribution to better understanding this demanding substantive domain. Whilst the substantive insights and theoretical propositions reported here were derived from, and may be limited by, a sub-specialty of nursing and a single geographic location, they were earthed in the personal self-reported experience of those directly involved with a clinical practice innovation. They may resonate with counterparts beyond mental health nursing and Queensland, Australia, respectively, therefore, and may assist in both conceptualising and operationalising CS research, education, management, policy and clinical practice development decision making in the future. ¬© The Author(s), 2010.",10.1177/1744987109357816,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Mental Health,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The description does not provide specific information about whether the study showed statistically significant results
Boreland F.; Lesjak M.; Lyle D.,Evaluation of home lead remediation in an Australian mining community,2009,"In 1994 a comprehensive program was established to reduce children's blood lead levels in Broken Hill, NSW, Australia. Home remediation (abatement of lead hazards in a child's home) was included as part of a case management strategy for children with blood lead levels ‚â• 15 Œºg/dL. Children with blood lead levels ‚â• 30 Œºg/dL were offered immediate home remediation. Children with blood lead levels of 15-29 Œºg/dL were allocated to 'immediate' or 'delayed' home remediation; a subset of these participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of home remediation for reducing blood lead levels. One hundred and seventeen children received home remediation. One hundred and thirteen returned for follow-up blood tests, 88 of whom participated in the RCT. On average children's blood lead levels decreased by 1.7 Œºg/dL (10%) in the 6 months after remediation and by 2.2 Œºg/dL (13%) in the 6-12 months after remediation. However, remediation did not significantly change the rate of decline in blood lead levels (P = 0.609). There was no evidence of association between change in children's blood lead levels and changes in lead loading in their homes. The results are consistent with the published literature, which suggests that home remediation does not reduce children's exposure to lead sufficiently to cause a moderate or greater decrease in their blood lead level. In communities where lead is widely dispersed, the study suggests that it is important to assess potential sources and pathways by which children are exposed to lead when developing an intervention plan, and the need for multiple interventions to effectively reduce blood lead levels. The findings reinforce the ongoing need for rigorous epidemiological evaluation of lead management programs to improve the evidence base, and for effective primary prevention to avoid children being exposed to lead in the first place. ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The study was a community-clustered randomised controlled trial over two years, set in 30 remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory of Australia. Children aged 18-47 months at baseline were enrolled in the study. The intervention included fluoride varnish applications, training of primary care workers, and health promotion for oral health at an individual, family and community level. Intervention communities received six-monthly visits over two years and control communities were visited at baseline and two years later with no contact in the intervening period. The outcome measures reported in this paper are the impact of the intervention on two secondary endpoints: oral health promotion activities in the community and personal oral health practices of children. Results: The intervention did not produce any significant change in oral health behaviours, clinical measures of oral hygiene, or community programmes promoting oral health.

Design: Cluster-randomised trial with intention-to-treat analysis. Participants: 115 adolescent females from four regional sporting academies aged 16 yr (SD 1) and with an average Australian bra size of 12B. Intervention: The experimental group received an education booklet on bra fit and breast support from a sports physiotherapist. The control group received no intervention. Outcome measures: The primary outcome was bra knowledge measured by a questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were a pass on the Bra Fit Assessment and the Level of Breast Support tests, and breast discomfort during exercise rated on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. Results: Four months after receiving the education booklet, the experimental group had improved their bra knowledge 19% (95% CI 14 to 25) more than the control group. In addition, 39% (95% CI 19 to 54) more of the experimental group passed the Bra Fit Assessment test and 30% (95% CI 11 to 47) more passed the Level of Breast Support test than the control group at 4 months. There was no difference in the level of breast discomfort during exercise.

Graves N.; Barnett A.G.; Halton K.A.; Veerman J.L.; Winkler E.; Owen N.; Reeves M.M.; Marshall A.; Eakin E.,Cost-effectiveness of a telephone-delivered intervention for physical activity and diet,2009,"Background: Given escalating rates of chronic disease, broad-reach and cost-effective interventions to increase physical activity and improve dietary intake are needed. The cost-effectiveness of a Telephone Counselling intervention to improve physical activity and diet, targeting adults with established chronic diseases in a low socio-economic area of a major Australian city was examined. Methodology/Principal Findings: A cost-effectiveness modelling study using data collected between February 2005 and November 2007 from a cluster-randomised trial that compared Telephone Counselling with a ""Usual Care"" (brief intervention) alternative. Economic outcomes were assessed using a state-transition Markov model, which predicted the progress of participants through five health states relating to physical activity and dietary improvement, for ten years after recruitment. The costs and health benefits of Telephone Counselling, Usual Care and an existing practice (Real Control) group were compared. Telephone Counselling compared to Usual Care was not cost-effective ($78,489 per quality adjusted life year gained). However, the Usual Care group did not represent existing practice and is not a useful comparator for decision making. Comparing Telephone Counselling outcomes to existing practice (Real Control), the intervention was found to be cost-effective ($29,375 per quality adjusted life year gained). Usual Care (brief intervention) compared to existing practice (Real Control) was also cost-effective ($12,153 per quality adjusted life year gained). Conclusions/Significance: This modelling study shows that a decision to adopt a Telephone Counselling program over existing practice (Real Control) is likely to be cost-effective. Choosing the 'Usual Care' brief intervention over existing practice (Real Control) shows a lower cost per quality adjusted life year, but the lack of supporting evidence for efficacy or sustainability is an important consideration for decision makers. The economics of behavioural approaches to improving health must be made explicit if decision makers are to be convinced that allocating resources toward such programs is worthwhile. ¬© 2009 Graves et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0007135,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Public Health,This is a full study with results.,Something else,A clustered RCT,The sample size is not given.,The abstract does not provide information on whether the results were statistically significant.

Monaghan S.; Blaszczynski A.,Impact of mode of display and message content of responsible gambling signs for electronic gaming machines on regular gamblers,2010,"Harm-minimization strategies aim to reduce gambling-related risks; however, minimal evidence supports the effectiveness of current strategies involving the placement of warning signs in gambling venues and on electronic gaming machines (EGMs). This qualitative replication study evaluated the differential effect of pop-up messages compared to static signs and the content of messages on EGMs on recall, thoughts, and behaviors assessed during the session and at 2-week follow-up. In Study 1, 127 regular EGM gamblers (male = 97, mean age = 20. 3) recruited from a university student population attended a laboratory where they were randomly assigned to play a computer-based simulated EGM analogue displaying signs that differed by (a) mode of presentation (pop-up and static) and (b) message content (informative, self-appraisal, and control/blank). In Study 2, an identical methodology was used but included the use of a simulated EGM within an in vivo gaming setting with 124 regular EGM players (male = 81, mean age = 44.1). Results from both studies showed that pop-up messages were recalled more effectively than static messages immediately and at 2-week follow-up. Pop-up messages reportedly had a significantly greater impact on within-session thoughts and behaviors. Messages encouraging self-appraisal resulted in significantly greater effect on self-reported thoughts and behaviors during both the experimental session and in subsequent EGM play. These findings support the effectiveness of pop-up messages containing self-appraisal messages as an appropriate harm-minimization initiative. ¬© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",10.1007/s10899-009-9150-z,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Gambling Regulation,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,127 in Study 1 and 124 in Study 2.,"Yes, the study showed statistically significant results.

Palmer E.J.; Devitt P.G.,Limitations of student-driven formative assessment in a clinical clerkship. A randomised controlled trial,2008,"Background. Teachers strive to motivate their students to be self-directed learners. One of the methods used is to provide online formative assessment material. The concept of formative assessment and use of these processes is heavily promoted, despite limited evidence as to their efficacy. Methods. Fourth year medical students, in their first year of clinical work were divided into four groups. In addition to the usual clinical material, three of the groups were provided with some form of supplementary learning material. For two groups, this was provided as online formative assessment. The amount of time students spent on the supplementary material was measured, their opinion on learning methods was surveyed, and their performance in summative exams at the end of their surgical attachments was measured. Results. The performance of students was independent of any educational intervention imposed by this study. Despite its ready availability and promotion, student use of the online formative tools was poor. Conclusion. Formative learning is an ideal not necessarily embraced by students. If formative assessment is to work students need to be encouraged to participate, probably by implementing some form of summative assessment. ¬© 2008 Palmer and Devitt; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1472-6920-8-29,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Education Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,The sample size is not given.,The study did not show statistically significant results.

Duggan P.M.; Palmer E.; Devitt P.,Electronic voting to encourage interactive lectures: A randomised trial,2007,"Background. Electronic Voting Systems have been used for education in a variety of disciplines. Outcomes from these studies have been mixed. Because results from these studies have been mixed, we examined whether an EVS system could enhance a lecture's effect on educational outcomes. Methods. A cohort of 127 Year 5 medical students at the University of Adelaide was stratified by gender, residency status and academic record then randomised into 2 groups of 64 and 63 students. Each group received consecutive 40-minute lectures on two clinical topics. One group received the EVS for both topics. The other group received traditional teaching only. Evaluation was undertaken with two, 15-question multiple-choice questionnaires (MCQ) assessing knowledge and problem solving and undertaken as a written paper immediately before and after the lectures and repeated online 8-12 weeks later. Standardised institutional student questionnaires were completed for each lecture and independent observers assessed student behaviour during the lectures. Lecturer's opinions were assessed by a questionnaire developed for this study. Results. Two-thirds of students randomised to EVS and 59% of students randomised to traditional lectures attended. One-half of the students in the EVS group and 41% in the traditional group completed all questionnaires. There was no difference in MCQ scores between EVS and traditional lectures (p = 0.785). The cervical cancer lectures showed higher student ranking in favour of EVS in all parameters. The breast cancer lectures showed higher ranking in favour of traditional lectures in 5 of 7 parameters (p < 0.001). The observed higher-order lecturer-students interactions were increased in the EVS lecture for one lecturer and reduced for the other. Both lecturers felt that the EVS lectures were difficult to prepare, that they were able to keep to time in the traditional lectures, that the educational value of both lecture styles was similar, and that they were neutral-to-slightly favourably disposed to continue with the EVS technology. The 2 lecturers disagreed regarding the ease of preparation of the traditional lecture, their ability to keep to time in the EVS lecture, and personal satisfaction with the EVS lecture. The lecturers felt that EVS encouraged student participation and helped identify where students were having difficulty. Conclusion. In this setting, EVS technology used in large group lectures did not offer significant advantages over the more traditional lecture format. ¬© 2007 Duggan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1472-6920-7-25,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Education Policy,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,127,The study did not show statistically significant results in terms of MCQ scores between
Boreland F.; Lyle D.M.,Lead dust in Broken Hill homes: Effect of remediation on indoor lead levels,2006,"This study was undertaken to determine whether home remediation effectively reduced indoor lead levels in Broken Hill, a long-established silver-lead-zinc mining town in outback Australia. A before-after study of the effect of home remediation on indoor lead levels was embedded into a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of remediation for reducing elevated blood lead levels in young children. Moist towelettes were used to measure lead loading (Œºg/m2) on internal windowsills and internal and entry floors of 98 homes; samples were collected before, immediately after, and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months after remediation. Data were log10 transformed for the analysis. Remediation reduced average indoor lead levels by approximately 50%, and lead levels remained low for the duration of the follow-up period (10 months). The greatest gains were made in homes with the highest initial lead levels; homes with low preremediation lead levels showed little or no benefit. Before remediation, homes located in areas with high soil lead levels or with ""poor"" dust proofing had higher lead levels than those in areas with lower soil lead levels or with ""medium"" or ""good"" dust proofing; these relative differences remained after remediation. There was no evidence that lead loading was reduced by an increased opportunity to become aware of lead issues. We conclude that remediation is an effective strategy for reducing the lead exposure of children living in homes with high indoor lead levels. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Dyke P.; Jamrozik K.; Plant A.J.,A randomized trial of a problem-based learning approach for teaching epidemiology,2001,"Purpose. To conduct a controlled trial of traditional and problem-based learning (PBL) methods of teaching epidemiology. Method. All second-year medical students (n = 136) at The University of Western Australia Medical School were offered the chance to participate in a randomized controlled trial of teaching methods for an epidemiology course. Students who consented to participate (n = 80) were randomly assigned to either a PBL or a traditional course. Students who did not consent or did not return the consent form (n = 56) were assigned to the traditional course. Students in both streams took identical quizzes and exams. These scores, a collection of semi-quantitative feedback from all students, and a qualitative analysis of interviews with a convenience sample of six students from each stream were compared. Results. There was no significant difference in performances on quizzes or exams between PBL and traditional students. Students using PBL reported a stronger grasp of epidemiologic principles, enjoyed working with a group, and, at the end of the course, were more enthusiastic about epidemiology and its professional relevance to them than were students in the traditional course. PBL students worked more steadily during the semester but spent only marginally more time on the epidemiology course overall. Interviews corroborated these findings. Non-consenting students were older (p < 0.02) and more likely to come from non-English-speaking backgrounds (p < 0.005). Conclusions. PBL provides an academically equivalent but personally far richer learning experience. The adoption of PBL approaches to medical education makes it important to study whether PBL presents particular challenges for students whose first language is not the language of instruction.",10.1097/00001888-200104000-00016,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct 24 Scopus,,,,Education Policy,Full study with results.,Field experiment,Regular RCT,136,The study did not show statistically significant differences in performances on quizzes or exams between

Given that the performance of the school has become an important dependent variable in school effects research, it follows that interventions which address behaviour management and the improvement of academic performance, have also taken on a school-wide focus or orientation. In Australia, where this study was conducted, there has been an increased interest in the use of school-wide behaviour management and discipline programmes, which are characterized by their focus on improving teachers‚Äô classroom management skills. In the present study randomly selected teachers from schools involved in a school-wide behaviour management programme participated in an experimental evaluation of the effects of the programme. Continuous data collection indicated that the majority of teachers made increases in their use of encouragement over the course of the intervention. However, observations conducted during a follow-up phase revealed reductions in levels of encouragement following the withdrawal of the intervention. ¬© 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Milligan-Saville et al.,Workplace mental health training for managers and its effect on sick leave in employees: a cluster randomised controlled trial,2017,"Background
Mental illness is one of the most rapidly increasing causes of long-term sickness absence, despite improved rates of detection and development of more effective interventions. However, mental health training for managers might help improve occupational outcomes for people with mental health problems. We aimed to investigate the effect of mental health training on managers' knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and behaviour towards employees with mental health problems, and its effect on employee sickness absence.
Methods
We did a cluster randomised controlled trial of manager mental health training within a large Australian fire and rescue service, with a 6-month follow-up. Managers (clusters) at the level of duty commander or equivalent were randomly assigned (1:1) using an online random sequence generator to either a 4-h face-to-face RESPECT mental health training programme or a deferred training control group. Researchers, managers, and employees were not masked to the outcome of randomisation. Firefighters and station officers supervised by each manager were included in the study via their anonymised sickness absence records. The primary outcome measure was change in sickness absence among those supervised by each of the managers. We analysed rates of work-related sick leave and standard sick leave seperately, with rate being defined as sickness absence hours divided by the sum of hours of sickness absence and hours of attendance. This trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12613001156774).
Findings
128 managers were recruited between Feb 18, 2014, and May 17, 2014. 46 (71%) of 65 managers allocated to the intervention group received the intervention, and 42 (67%) of 63 managers allocated to the control group were entered in the deferred training group. Managers and their employees were followed up and reassessed at 6 months after randomisation. 25 managers (1233 employees) in the intervention group and 19 managers (733 employees) in the control group provided data for the primary analysis. During the 6-month follow-up, the mean rate of work-related sick leave decreased by 0¬∑28 percentage points (pp) from a pre-training mean of 1¬∑56% (SE 0¬∑23) in the intervention group and increased by 0¬∑28 pp from 0¬∑95% (0¬∑20) in the control group (p=0¬∑049), corresponding to a reduction of 6¬∑45 h per employee per 6 months. The mean percentage of standard sick leave increased by 0¬∑48 pp from 4¬∑97% (0¬∑22) in the intervention group and by 0¬∑31 pp from 5¬∑27% (0¬∑21) in the control group (p=0¬∑169).
Interpretation
A 4-h manager mental health training programme could lead to a significant reduction in work-related sickness absence, with an associated return on investment of ¬£9.98 for each pound spent on such training.

Method: A prospective, two-armed randomized controlled trial of 110 overweight/obese (BMI 25-40) (mean [SD] age = 44.4 [8.6] years; BMI = 30.5 [3.6]) male employees at Tomago Aluminium aged 18-65. In October (2009) men were randomized to either (i) WP program (n=65) or (ii) a 14-week wait-list control group (n=45). The 3-month program involved one information session, program booklets, group-based financial incentives and an online component. Men were assessed at baseline and at 14-week follow-up for weight (primary outcome), waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, resting heart rate, self-reported physical activity and dietary variables, and physical activity and dietary cognitions.

Results: Intention-to-treat analysis using linear mixed models revealed significant between group differences for weight loss after 14 weeks (P < .001, Cohen's d = 0.34).

Design: A cost-utility analysis from a government-as-payer perspective alongside a randomised trial of NHV over 3-year period. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted at 5%. Analysis used an intention-to-treat approach with multiple imputation.

Setting: The right@home was implemented from 2013 in Victoria and Tasmania states of Australia, as a primary care service for pregnant women, delivered until child age 2 years.

Participants: 722 pregnant Australian women experiencing adversity received NHV (n=363) or usual care (clinic visits) (n=359).

Primary and secondary outcome measures: First, a cost-consequences analysis to compare the additional costs of NHV over usual care, accounting for any reduced costs of service use, and impacts on all maternal and child outcomes assessed at 3 years. Second, cost-utility analysis from a government-as-payer perspective compared additional costs to maternal QALYs to express cost-effectiveness in terms of additional cost per additional QALY gained.

Results: When compared with usual care at child age 3 years, the right@home intervention cost $A7685 extra per woman (95% CI $A7006 to $A8364) and generated 0.01 more QALYs (95% CI -0.01 to 0.02). The probability of right@home being cost-effective by child age 3 years is less than 20%, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $A50 000 per QALY.

Conclusions: Benefits of NHV to parenting at 2 years and maternal health and well-being at 3 years translate into marginal maternal QALY gains. Like previous cost-effectiveness results for NHV programmes, right@home is not cost-effective at 3 years. Given the relatively high up-front costs of NHV, long-term follow-up is needed to assess the accrual of health and economic benefits over time.",10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052156,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,Healthcare Policy,Full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised trial,722,The study did not show statistically significant results.

NSW Behavioural Insights,Reducing missed hospital appointments with better text messages,2019,"Reducing missed hospital appointments with better text messages
Each year thousands of patients miss their outpatient appointments at hospitals. St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital wanted to reduce the number of missed hospitals appointments even further and reached out to us to see if behavioural insights could be used to achieve this. 


Listen
While St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital send reminder text messages to patients to remind them of their outpatient appointments, nearly 15 per cent of people still miss their appointments. Each missed appointment reduces patient care and costs the hospital money.

Our research that found it wasn‚Äôt enough to send a reminder text message - the content of the message also matters.

We worked with St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital to test different types of text message reminders to see which one was the most effective at getting people to attend their appointment.

Two randomised controlled trials were conducted. Each trial ran for six-months over a 13-month period and included nearly two-thirds of all outpatient appointments at the hospital. During the two trials around 20,000 text messages were sent to nearly 7,500 people.

First trial
In the first trial, seven new messages were developed. The new messages built on the original text message reminder sent by St Vincent‚Äôs Hospitals.

 

Version	Text message
Original	You have an appointment with Dr [XXXX] in [clinic XXXX] on [date] at [time]. For enquiries, call 8382‚Äì3150. Do not reply.
Version 1	Original Message + Last year the hospital lost $500,000 due to lost appointments.
Version 2	Original Message + If you do not attend the hospital loses $125.
Version 3	Original Message + If you do not attend the hospital loses $125 that can be used to treat other patients.
Version 4	Original Message + If you attend the hospital will not lose the $125 we lose when a patient does not show up.
Version 5	Original Message + By attending the hospital will not lose the $125 that we lose when a patient does not turn up. This money will be used to treat other patients.
Version 6	Original Message + You are free not to attend but please call us on 8382‚Äì3150 if you need to cancel or rearrange.
Version 7	Original Message + Please attend or call 8382‚Äì3150 to cancel/rearrange, or we will record as a missed appt.
 

The two most effective messages were Versions 4 and 5.

Second trial
The second trial tested four messages: the two most effective messages from the first trial and two new messages which focused on non-financial impacts that missed appointments have on clinics and staff.

 

Version	Text message
Version 8	We are expecting you at [clinic XXXXXX] on [day] [date] at [time]. If you do not attend, St Vincent‚Äôs loses the ability to treat others in need of our services. Please call 8382‚Äì3150 if you need to cancel or rearrange.
Version 9	We are expecting you at [clinic XXXXXX] on [day] [date] at [time]. Your clinic is depending on you to attend. Please call 8382‚Äì3150 if you need to cancel or rearrange.
 

While all of the messages in the second trial led to a reduction in people missing their appointments, the most effective message was Version 5:

You have an appointment with Dr [XXXX] in [clinic XXXX] on [date] at [time]. By attending the hospital will not lose the $125 that we lose when a patient does not turn up. This money will be used to treat other patients.

During the first trial there was a 19 per cent reduction in the number of the people missing their appointments, which saved St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital over $68,000.

The information from the second trial was used by St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital to better target their messaging strategies for patients in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,Healthcare,This is a full study with results.,Field experiment,Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT),"7,500",The study showed statistically significant results.
